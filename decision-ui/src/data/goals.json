Our markets will be open to all who have a\nbusiness interest in them without any artificial restrictions.\"\n   Some think the electronic OTC market could provide tough competition for\nfutures exchanges despite providing lesser guarantees than more tightly\nregulated contracts.\n   \"If the market becomes mature enough, liquid enough and enough players\ntake an active part in its development, it could take a good stake from the\nfutures market,\" said one European oil trader not involved in the venture.\n   The New York Mercantile Exchange, the world's leading energy futures\nmarket, last week said it had declined a proposal by Morgan Stanley and\nGoldman Sachs to team up on an electronic communications network.\n   Traditional broking houses might also lose out although dealers said an\nelectronic market could not replicate the sort of information provided\nperson-to-person by brokers.\n   \"The idea definitely has merit. But I don't believe it is going to be the\nimmediate downfall of brokers. If you look at the trading screen what kind\nof information do you get? Very little,\" said Bo van Wijk of Standard Bank\nof London.\n   The seven companies said there would be no formal membership of the\nexchange and no dues or fees beyond those incurred in the process of\ntrading.\n   Currently the bulk of trading in the wholesale OTC energy and metals\nmarkets is conducted on the telephone. Beyond the benefits of electronic\nlinks, the exchange will create a \"paperless back office,\" the companies\nsaid.\n   They also plan to develop facilities which would permit participants to\nclear and settle OTC products.\n\nFor related news, double click on one of the following codes:\n[ELE] [ELN] [LEN] [RTRS]\n[BPA.L\\c] [RD.AS\\c] [SHEL.L\\c] [TOTF.PA\\c] [GS.N\\c] [SOGN.PA\\c]\n\nFor related price quotes, double click on one of the following codes:\n<BPA.L> <RD.AS> <SHEL.L> <TOTF.PA> <GS.N> <SOGN.PA>\n\nTuesday, 21 March 2000 12:52:11\nRTRS [nL21251729]\n\n\n"

(Revised)\n\nThe hardest part of preparing the Long Descriptions is making sure all of t=\nhe=20\nterms used in th GTC's that need to be defined elsewhere are covered.  I'll=\n=20\nhave to leave the final determination to the people who drafted the GTC's. =\n I=20\nalso have to point out I don't know much of anything about how bandwidth is=\n=20\ntraded, but here are the comments I was able to come up with to the Long=20\nDescriptions:\n\nBandwidth Units - This concept has been difficult for me - it's not entirel=\ny=20\nclear to me where the definition of this comes from - is it the reference i=\nn=20\nthe box at the top of the relevant Annex?  You are correct. If so, maybe we=\n=20\nshould add a line something to the effect of 'Bandwidth Units shall mean DS=\n-3=20\nfor this Transaction.'  Or better yet you might consider a generic referenc=\ne=20\nto the relevant Annex that should apply which might let you delete the=20\nsentence referring to the quality as well. We have changed the first senten=\nce=20\nof the long description to read \" A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron=20\nBroadband Services, L.P. (\"EBS\") pursuant to which the Seller shall sell an=\nd=20\nthe Buyer shall buy the quantity of DS3 Bandwidth Units submitted by=20\nCounterparty via the Website.\n\nDoes 'DSO' need to be defined somewhere? DS0 is a term generally known in t=\nhe=20\nindustry and is only used in the calculation of the Contract Price in the=\n=20\nlong description, so we chose not to define it - also the definition is=20\nincredibly long, complex and technical.  If you feel strongly about it, we=\n=20\ncan include it, but since the long description tells you how many DS0's you=\n=20\nshould include for calculation purposes, we didn't think that it was=20\nnecessary.\n\nThe way the different Price definitions fit together has also eluded me -=\n=20\nthere is a formula in the Long Description and a different formula in the=\n=20\nGTC.  The formula in the long description differs from the formula in the G=\nTC=20\n(and in the Master Agreement) in order to accomodate the way that the price=\n=20\nis being quoted on EnronOnline. The quote represents the variable component=\n=20\nof the \"Unit Price\" in the GTC's and the Master Agreement - In order not to=\n=20\nconfuse people, we decided to include the formula in both the long=20\ndescription and the confirmation so that customers could know that the Unit=\n=20\nPrice was calculated using the price quoted.  Unless industry trading=20\nconvention is to the contrary, the site makes more intuitive sense when the=\n=20\nvolume quoted and the price quoted use the same units.  If the volume is=20\nBandwidth Units and the price is a per mile number some counterparties (or=\n=20\nperhaps more likely their lawyers) may be confused.  The GTC contains the=\n=20\ndefined term 'Unit Price' which is in $/Bandwidth Unit.  It seems to me tha=\nt=20\nif we can quote the price as the Unit Price and the volume as Bandwidth=20\nUnits, we can ignore the number of DSO's per Bandwidth Unit and the number =\nof=20\nDSO miles for the transaction. =20\n\nSince they won't change from one product to the next, the two sentences=20\nbeginning with 'Any party entering into a Transaction...' could be moved to=\n=20\nthe GTC. Since bandwidth is such a new product, we really wanted to highlig=\nht=20\nto customers that if they intend to take physical delivery of bandwidth=20\n(which is what we are offering) they will need to establish connectivity wi=\nth=20\nus.  This is already in the GTC - but in an abundance of caution, we wanted=\n=20\nthis fact highlighted, especially since connectivity will entail further=20\ncosts to the customer as well as signing documentation such as colocation=\n=20\nagreements, licenses etc. - this can be quite an involved process.\n\nThe term 'Contractual Currency' is not used int he GTC.  Can the=20\nparenthetical reference come out?  (The EnronOnline people may care about=\n=20\nthis more than I.) Agreed\n\nIf the numbers of miles and DSO's need to stay in the Long Descriptions, I=\n=20\nwould suggest that you change the references to make it DSO's per Bandwidth=\n=20\nUnit (both where the number is introduced and in the price formula) and tha=\nt=20\nthe unt of measure against which the price is quoted be 'per DSO mile per=\n=20\nmonth'. It is a quote for one DS0 mile of a Bandwidth Unit for a month. =20\nSince the short description indicates the period for the contract being=20\noffered, we felt like the quotation was pretty clear.  We are also a bit=20\nsensitive to using too many defined terms referring to each other in the lo=\nng=20\ndescription.  From a commercial perspective, we are comfortable that the=20\nlanguage used in the quote and the long description are clear and accurate.\n\nIs the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number?  This needs to =\nbe=20\nclear from the Long Description.  If a Customer wanted to buy 5 of the OC3=\n=20\nBandwidth Units quoted for the period from July 1- July 31, the Customer=20\nwould be entitled to 5 OC3's for the period from July 1 - July 31.  I hope=\n=20\nthat this is responsive to your question - we weren't entirely clear.\n\n\nSo for example, if you follow all of my suggestions, you might end up with=\n=20\nsomething like this:\n\nA US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018=\n)=20\npursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit=\ny=20\nof Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website.

(Revised)\n\nThe hardest part of preparing the Long Descriptions is making sure all of t=\nhe=20\nterms used in th GTC's that need to be defined elsewhere are covered.  I'll=\n=20\nhave to leave the final determination to the people who drafted the GTC's. =\n I=20\nalso have to point out I don't know much of anything about how bandwidth is=\n=20\ntraded, but here are the comments I was able to come up with to the Long=20\nDescriptions:\n\nBandwidth Units - This concept has been difficult for me - it's not entirel=\ny=20\nclear to me where the definition of this comes from - is it the reference i=\nn=20\nthe box at the top of the relevant Annex?  You are correct. If so, maybe we=\n=20\nshould add a line something to the effect of 'Bandwidth Units shall mean DS=\n-3=20\nfor this Transaction.'  Or better yet you might consider a generic referenc=\ne=20\nto the relevant Annex that should apply which might let you delete the=20\nsentence referring to the quality as well. We have changed the first senten=\nce=20\nof the long description to read \" A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron=20\nBroadband Services, L.P. (\"EBS\") pursuant to which the Seller shall sell an=\nd=20\nthe Buyer shall buy the quantity of DS3 Bandwidth Units submitted by=20\nCounterparty via the Website.\n\nDoes 'DSO' need to be defined somewhere? DS0 is a term generally known in t=\nhe=20\nindustry and is only used in the calculation of the Contract Price in the=\n=20\nlong description, so we chose not to define it - also the definition is=20\nincredibly long, complex and technical.  If you feel strongly about it, we=\n=20\ncan include it, but since the long description tells you how many DS0's you=\n=20\nshould include for calculation purposes, we didn't think that it was=20\nnecessary.\n\nThe way the different Price definitions fit together has also eluded me -=\n=20\nthere is a formula in the Long Description and a different formula in the=\n=20\nGTC.  The formula in the long description differs from the formula in the G=\nTC=20\n(and in the Master Agreement) in order to accomodate the way that the price=\n=20\nis being quoted on EnronOnline. The quote represents the variable component=\n=20\nof the \"Unit Price\" in the GTC's and the Master Agreement - In order not to=\n=20\nconfuse people, we decided to include the formula in both the long=20\ndescription and the confirmation so that customers could know that the Unit=\n=20\nPrice was calculated using the price quoted.  Unless industry trading=20\nconvention is to the contrary, the site makes more intuitive sense when the=\n=20\nvolume quoted and the price quoted use the same units.  If the volume is=20\nBandwidth Units and the price is a per mile number some counterparties (or=\n=20\nperhaps more likely their lawyers) may be confused.  The GTC contains the=\n=20\ndefined term 'Unit Price' which is in $/Bandwidth Unit.  It seems to me tha=\nt=20\nif we can quote the price as the Unit Price and the volume as Bandwidth=20\nUnits, we can ignore the number of DSO's per Bandwidth Unit and the number =\nof=20\nDSO miles for the transaction. =20\n\nSince they won't change from one product to the next, the two sentences=20\nbeginning with 'Any party entering into a Transaction...' could be moved to=\n=20\nthe GTC. Since bandwidth is such a new product, we really wanted to highlig=\nht=20\nto customers that if they intend to take physical delivery of bandwidth=20\n(which is what we are offering) they will need to establish connectivity wi=\nth=20\nus.  This is already in the GTC - but in an abundance of caution, we wanted=\n=20\nthis fact highlighted, especially since connectivity will entail further=20\ncosts to the customer as well as signing documentation such as colocation=\n=20\nagreements, licenses etc. - this can be quite an involved process.\n\nThe term 'Contractual Currency' is not used int he GTC.  Can the=20\nparenthetical reference come out?  (The EnronOnline people may care about=\n=20\nthis more than I.) Agreed\n\nIf the numbers of miles and DSO's need to stay in the Long Descriptions, I=\n=20\nwould suggest that you change the references to make it DSO's per Bandwidth=\n=20\nUnit (both where the number is introduced and in the price formula) and tha=\nt=20\nthe unt of measure against which the price is quoted be 'per DSO mile per=\n=20\nmonth'. It is a quote for one DS0 mile of a Bandwidth Unit for a month. =20\nSince the short description indicates the period for the contract being=20\noffered, we felt like the quotation was pretty clear.  We are also a bit=20\nsensitive to using too many defined terms referring to each other in the lo=\nng=20\ndescription.  From a commercial perspective, we are comfortable that the=20\nlanguage used in the quote and the long description are clear and accurate.\n\nIs the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number?  This needs to =\nbe=20\nclear from the Long Description.  If a Customer wanted to buy 5 of the OC3=\n=20\nBandwidth Units quoted for the period from July 1- July 31, the Customer=20\nwould be entitled to 5 OC3's for the period from July 1 - July 31.  I hope=\n=20\nthat this is responsive to your question - we weren't entirely clear.\n\n\nSo for example, if you follow all of my suggestions, you might end up with=\n=20\nsomething like this:\n\nA US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018=\n)=20\npursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit=\ny=20\nof Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website.

(ENE, news, msgs) suggested \ntrading bandwidth as a commodity under standard terms and conditions. \n\tBandwidth is the capacity to move data on telecommunications networks. \n\tMany observers thought that such a market would be ideal for Williams \nCommunications. After all, 85% of its stock is owned by Williams Co. (WMB, \nnews, msgs), which has been trading energy commodities like crude oil and \nnatural gas for years. \n\tBut Williams Communications didn't get behind the idea until February when it \ntold industry analysts it had formed a bandwidth trading group. The new group \nincludes Sharon Crow, who had been a gas trader and risk manager with \nWilliams Energy Services, a unit of Williams Co. She is now vice president of \nbandwidth trading for Williams Communications. \n\tSince then, a number of other companies have said they want to play in that \nmarket - Dynegy Inc. (DYN, news, msgs); El Paso Energy Corp. (EPG, news, msgs\n); Columbia Transmission Communications, a unit of Columbia Energy Group (CG, \nnews, msgs); and Koch Industries. \n\tThose companies all have one thing in common and it isn't ownership of \ntelecommunications bandwidth. They all have years of experience trading \nenergy commodities. \n\tLast month companies from the energy side joined some carriers and others \ninterested in standardized trading of bandwidth at a meeting put together by \nCompTel, a telecom industry trade association. \n\tAt that meeting they decided who would be considered principals in the \nbandwidth trading market - companies that will \"take title to,\" or own, \nbandwidth. In other words, principals will be either telecom carriers or \ncompanies that will buy and sell bandwidth to manage risk in the \ntelecommunications industry. \n\tThey also formed a committee of principals to study standard terms and \nconditions needed to establish a liquid market for bandwidth trading. \n\tPeople who attended the meeting said two of the largest carriers were missing \nat the CompTel meeting. MCI WorldCom (WCOM, news, msgs) was there but AT&T (T\n, news, msgs) and Sprint (FON, news, msgs) weren't. \n\tThe meeting next week, which starts Monday, is for telecom carriers only, \nEpps said. This week, he wouldn't mention names of the companies invited, but \nlast month he told Dow Jones Newswires his company's meeting would include \n\"the real players, the MCI WorldComms, the Qwests (Q, news, msgs), the \nAT&Ts.... It's about people who have the assets and how we use these to \nadvantage the marketplace, how we build a good powerful market model,\" Epps \nsaid. \n\t\n\t\nWilliams Invites Telecom Carriers To Talk Bandwidth\nFriday, April 7, 2000 04:36 PM\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t?Mail this article to a friend \n\t\t\n\t\tBy Michael Rieke \n\t\tHOUSTON (Dow Jones)--Following up on its February pledge to be a leader in \ndeveloping a liquid market for telecommunications bandwidth, Williams \nCommunications Group (WCG, news, msgs) will host a meeting of telecom \ncarriers next week. \n\t\tKen Epps, senior vice president for strategic marketing for Williams \nCommunications, told Dow Jones Newswires that the first objective for the \nmeeting will be understanding any concerns carriers might have about a market \nfor standardized trading of bandwidth. \n\t\tThat's a sensible approach for Williams Communications because the company \nwasn't impressed last May when Enron Corp.

Although September would probably be OK, it \nmay be helpful it the review was moved to June/July.\n\nPulp, Paper and Lumber-:  Looks OK.\n\nAlthough it is not ENA, I would recommend a review of EBS  Bandwidth Trading \nfor the latter part of the year.

          "body": "The hardest part of preparing the Long Descriptions is making sure all of t=\nhe=20\nterms used in th GTC's that need to be defined elsewhere are covered.  I'll=\n=20\nhave to leave the final determination to the people who drafted the GTC's. =\n I=20\nalso have to point out I don't know much of anything about how bandwidth is=\n=20\ntraded, but here are the comments I was able to come up with to the Long=20\nDescriptions:\n\nBandwidth Units - This concept has been difficult for me - it's not entirel=\ny=20\nclear to me where the definition of this comes from - is it the reference i=\nn=20\nthe box at the top of the relevant Annex?  If so, maybe we should add a lin=\ne=20\nsomething to the effect of 'Bandwidth Units shall mean DS-3 for this=20\nTransaction.'  Or better yet you might consider a generic reference to the=\n=20\nrelevant Annex that should apply which might let you delete the sentence=20\nreferring to the quality as well.\n\nDoes 'DSO' need to be defined somewhere?\n\nThe way the different Price definitions fit together has also eluded me -=\n=20\nthere is a formula in the Long Description and a different formula in the=\n=20\nGTC.  Unless industry trading convention is to the contrary, the site makes=\n=20\nmore intuitive sense when the volume quoted and the price quoted use the sa=\nme=20\nunits.  If the volume is Bandwidth Units and the price is a per mile number=\n=20\nsome counterparties (or perhaps more likely their lawyers) may be confused.=\n =20\nThe GTC contains the defined term 'Unit Price' which is in $/Bandwidth Unit=\n. =20\nIt seems to me that if we can quote the price as the Unit Price and the=20\nvolume as Bandwidth Units, we can ignore the number of DSO's per Bandwidth=\n=20\nUnit and the number of DSO miles for the transaction. =20\n\nSince they won't change from one product to the next, the two sentences=20\nbeginning with 'Any party entering into a Transaction...' could be moved to=\n=20\nthe GTC.\n\nThe term 'Contractual Currency' is not used int he GTC.  Can the=20\nparenthetical reference come out?  (The EnronOnline people may care about=\n=20\nthis more than I.)\n\nIf the numbers of miles and DSO's need to stay in the Long Descriptions, I=\n=20\nwould suggest that you change the references to make it DSO's per Bandwidth=\n=20\nUnit (both where the number is introduced and in the price formula) and tha=\nt=20\nthe unt of measure against which the price is quoted be 'per DSO mile per=\n=20\nmonth'.\n\nIs the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number?  This needs to =\nbe=20\nclear from the Long Description.\n\n\nSo for example, if you follow all of my suggestions, you might end up with=\n=20\nsomething like this:\n\nA US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018=\n)=20\npursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit=\ny=20\nof Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The price=20\nshall be as submitted by the Counterparty via the Website.  Annex A-1 of th=\ne=20\nGeneral Terms and Conditions shall apply to this Transaction. =20\nThe term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effectiv=\ne=20\nDate and continue to 11:59:59 p.m. (EST) on the Termination Date. The=20\nEffective Date is <Start Date> and the Termination Date is <Termination=20\nDate>. =20\nThe Transaction shall be for Bandwidth between the New York Market Pooling=\n=20\nPoint (111 8th Avenue, Suite 1517, New York, NY 10011, NPA-NXX: 212-462,=20\nCLLI: NYCMNY83H62) and the Los Angeles Market Pooling Point (530 W. 6th=20\nStreet, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 90014, NPA-NXX: 213-362, CLLI:=20\nLSAJCAWZH04).\nThe price is quoted in US Dollars.=20\nThe unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one Bandwidth Unit=\n=20\nper month and the quantity shown shall be in number of Bandwidth Units per=\n=20\nmonth.=20\n\n\nIf quoting the price as a per Bandwidth Unit number doesn't work it would b=\ne=20\nmore like this:\n\nA US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P.

You are correct. If so, maybe we=\n=20\nshould add a line something to the effect of 'Bandwidth Units shall mean DS=\n-3=20\nfor this Transaction.'  Or better yet you might consider a generic referenc=\ne=20\nto the relevant Annex that should apply which might let you delete the=20\nsentence referring to the quality as well. We have changed the first senten=\nce=20\nof the long description to read \" A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron=20\nBroadband Services, L.P. (\"EBS\") pursuant to which the Seller shall sell an=\nd=20\nthe Buyer shall buy the quantity of DS3 Bandwidth Units submitted by=20\nCounterparty via the Website.\n\nDoes 'DSO' need to be defined somewhere? DS0 is a term generally known in t=\nhe=20\nindustry and is only used in the calculation of the Contract Price in the=\n=20\nlong description, so we chose not to define it - also the definition is=20\nincredibly long, complex and technical.  If you feel strongly about it, we=\n=20\ncan include it, but since the long description tells you how many DS0's you=\n=20\nshould include for calculation purposes, we didn't think that it was=20\nnecessary.\n\nThe way the different Price definitions fit together has also eluded me -=\n=20\nthere is a formula in the Long Description and a different formula in the=\n=20\nGTC.  The formula in the long description differs from the formula in the G=\nTC=20\n(and in the Master Agreement) in order to accomodate the way that the price=\n=20\nis being quoted on EnronOnline. The quote represents the variable component=\n=20\nof the \"Unit Price\" in the GTC's and the Master Agreement - In order not to=\n=20\nconfuse people, we decided to include the formula in both the long=20\ndescription and the confirmation so that customers could know that the Unit=\n=20\nPrice was calculated using the price quoted.  Unless industry trading=20\nconvention is to the contrary, the site makes more intuitive sense when the=\n=20\nvolume quoted and the price quoted use the same units.  If the volume is=20\nBandwidth Units and the price is a per mile number some counterparties (or=\n=20\nperhaps more likely their lawyers) may be confused.  The GTC contains the=\n=20\ndefined term 'Unit Price' which is in $/Bandwidth Unit.  It seems to me tha=\nt=20\nif we can quote the price as the Unit Price and the volume as Bandwidth=20\nUnits, we can ignore the number of DSO's per Bandwidth Unit and the number =\nof=20\nDSO miles for the transaction. =20\n\nSince they won't change from one product to the next, the two sentences=20\nbeginning with 'Any party entering into a Transaction...' could be moved to=\n=20\nthe GTC. Since bandwidth is such a new product, we really wanted to highlig=\nht=20\nto customers that if they intend to take physical delivery of bandwidth=20\n(which is what we are offering) they will need to establish connectivity wi=\nth=20\nus.  This is already in the GTC - but in an abundance of caution, we wanted=\n=20\nthis fact highlighted, especially since connectivity will entail further=20\ncosts to the customer as well as signing documentation such as colocation=\n=20\nagreements, licenses etc. - this can be quite an involved process.\n\nThe term 'Contractual Currency' is not used int he GTC.  Can the=20\nparenthetical reference come out?  (The EnronOnline people may care about=\n=20\nthis more than I.) Agreed\n\nIf the numbers of miles and DSO's need to stay in the Long Descriptions, I=\n=20\nwould suggest that you change the references to make it DSO's per Bandwidth=\n=20\nUnit (both where the number is introduced and in the price formula) and tha=\nt=20\nthe unt of measure against which the price is quoted be 'per DSO mile per=\n=20\nmonth'. It is a quote for one DS0 mile of a Bandwidth Unit for a month. =20\nSince the short description indicates the period for the contract being=20\noffered, we felt like the quotation was pretty clear.  We are also a bit=20\nsensitive to using too many defined terms referring to each other in the lo=\nng=20\ndescription.  From a commercial perspective, we are comfortable that the=20\nlanguage used in the quote and the long description are clear and accurate.\n\nIs the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number?  This needs to =\nbe=20\nclear from the Long Description.  If a Customer wanted to buy 5 of the OC3=\n=20\nBandwidth Units quoted for the period from July 1- July 31, the Customer=20\nwould be entitled to 5 OC3's for the period from July 1 - July 31.

We enjoyed speaking with you regarding your plans for=20\ntaking the classroom to the web and feel that there are numerous=20\nopportunities for Enron and UT to work together on this venture.=20\n\nAs you requested, I am sending you additional information on the services=\n=20\nthat can be provided by Enron Broadband Services (EBS).  EBS offers two=20\ndistinct product offerings that could be provided to UT students. =20\n\n1) EBS offers our customers a full spectrum of bandwidth services.  This=20\nincludes dark fiber, OCX-lambdas, DS3 and above circuits, and bandwidth=20\nmanagement solutions.  Our focus is to help the enterprise customer add val=\nue=20\nand flexibility to their bandwidth service needs with features such as=20\nbandwidth \"on demand\".  EBS owns over 18,000 miles of fiber optic cable tha=\nt=20\nprovides EBS with an extensive network in the USA and Canada. =20\n\n2) Enron offers a full turn-key streaming media service called e PowerTM =\n=20\nMediaCast.  This service can involve the entire management of the entire=20\nprocess from filming through encoding, hosting and streaming or to supply t=\nhe=20\nspecific services that a client could need.   Each client  would access the=\nir=20\nclient's media through an URL embedded on the appropriate client=20\nwebsite(s).   The content can streamed live or stored to be played=20\non-demand.  EBS can deliver the streams at bit rates from 20kbps to 1Mbps o=\nr=20\nhigher.  There are no additional resources (hardware, software or human)=20\nrequired by a client to use our product. =20\n\nOur current customers has found the superior quality of e PowerTM =20\nMediaCast.has improved their ability to deliver a clear corporate philosoph=\ny=20\nand increase their customer retention.  The e PowerTM  MediaCast Network ha=\ns=20\na distributed server architecture supported by a private global fiber and=\n=20\nsatellite network (a pure Internet Protocol strategy) with embedded softwar=\ne=20\nintelligence that sets it apart from other network providers. The EBS e pow=\ner=20\nTM private network has dedicated servers in over 200 cities in the USA and=\n=20\nCanada. After the service is initiated, each client  can  access to reporti=\nng=20\nof the viewership statistics for your content on the EBS Intranet Site=20\n(www.epoweronline.com) that is updated on a daily basis.  Each client is=20\nprovided with a User ID and Password.  EBS guarantees their customers a=20\nsuperior quality of service level.      =20\n\nOur customers have found three major benefits.  First, Enron stores our=20\nclients' content on our servers which reduces the strain on clients' centra=\nl=20\nservers and Website.  Second, Enron constantly monitors its clients' sites=\n=20\nand updates its servers regularly to keep the data fresh.  Finally, Enron=\n=20\nsharply cuts the time it takes a viewer to receive our clients' content by=\n=20\ndelivering the media across Enron's private network and with the use of=20\nsoftware (bandwidth operating system) that decides within milliseconds whic=\nh=20\nEnron server can deliver the fastest.   To do that Enron servers, which=20\ndeliver our customer=01,s content, are located in over 200 cities in the US=\n and=20\nCanada.  This places your content close to the end user (typically, \"one-ho=\np\"=20\naway), and allows up to 500,000 simultaneous viewers at any time.  This=20\nenables high quality, rich media to be streamed without delay and congestio=\nn=20\nto an end user's desktop.  In fact, Enron recently announced plans to insta=\nll=20\n18,000 of our media servers (Compaq and Sun) into our global Data Centers=\n=20\nover a three year time period to extend our service domestically and=20\ninternationally.\n\nWe offer two internet sites to browse that demonstrates the true TV-like=20\nexperience of the e PowerTM  MediaCastexperience. =20\n\n 1) http://www.enron.net/mediacast\n =20\n a) User name and login ID are both  -  epower4.=20\n\n 2) http://www.enron.net/finance/srv_demo/enron/ms1250.html\n\n a) Once you are at this page called Today's Feature - click on the ACME TV=\n=20\nand chose one of the channels\n b) Chose the speed of your video player (either REAL or WindowsMedia Playe=\nr)\n c) Hit the play arrow button on the \"Screen\" that pops\n\n\nFinally, I estimate the cost per student to stream the course would be=20\napproximately $75.00.  Please remember this price is for the streaming only=\n,=20\nand is priced on a per MB delivered basis.  In addition, there will be a fl=\nat=20\nmonthly charge to administer the program.  Production and encoding can be=\n=20\nprovided at an additional cost.    Therefore, if the stream rates in my=20\nassumptions listed below change, our pricing will change slightly.  As you=\n=20\nwill see the cost for the streaming would be a minimal and would not prohib=\nit=20\nthe students from taking the course on-line.  I apologize that we do not ha=\nve=20\nany example distance learning clips that we are able to share with you at=\n=20\nthis time.  However, I would be happy to demonstrate our capabilities to yo=\nu=20\non your desktop, if you are interested.=20\n\nI look forward to discussing with you in greater detail how either of these=\n=20\nservices could be used to expand the reach of the University and its course=\n=20\nofferings.    I will contact your office at the beginning of next week to=\n=20\ncontinue this discussion.  If you would like to contact me prior to next=20\nweek, please do not hesitate to call me at 713 853-3242.   =20\n\nSincerely,\n\nTraci Warner\nDirector, Central Region Origination\nEnron Broadband Services\nPhone (713) 853-3242\nCell (713) 705-7201\n\n\n\nPrice Quote Assumptions:\n100 Students enrolled\n30 hours of course work per semester\n\nEncode at 4 rates - 28K, 56K, 100K, 300K\n\n# of students per viewing rate:\n15% at 28K\n40% at 56K\n25% at 100K\n20% at 300K\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

          "body": " \n Telecom Companies Mtg To Discuss Bandwidth Trading\n By Michael Rieke\n   \n 03/23/2000 \n Dow Jones Energy Service \n (Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) \n\n HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- A group of telecommunications companies is meeting \nThursday to open discussions\n on industry standards for bandwidth trading. \n\n Set up by CompTel, a Washington, D.C., trade association that represents the \ncompetitive telecommunications\n industry, the meeting will initiate discussion among companies that are or \nprobably will be active in a nascent\n bandwidth trading market that could be worth billions or trillions of \ndollars a year.\n\n Bandwidth is the capacity to move data over telecommunications networks. \n\n Russell Frisby Jr., president of CompTel, told Dow Jones Newswires that the \ntrade group's members asked it to\n get involved in the discussion of bandwidth trading. \n\n The fact that CompTel is involved in discussion on bandwidth trading shows \nthat people are taking the idea\n seriously, said Steven Kamman, a telecommunications analyst with CIBC World \nMarkets. \n\n \"This year bandwidth trading will move from a theory to practice,\" he said. \n\n Before that can happen, the industry needs to set ground rules for trading, \nand that will be a major topic of\n discussion at the meeting. \n\n It comes as no surprise that Enron Corp. (ENE) will be at the meeting. For \nnearly a year, the company has been\n promoting the idea of setting up a liquid market for trading bandwidth under \nstandard terms and conditions. \n\n Tom Gros, vice president of global bandwidth trading for Enron, has two \nitems he thinks should be at the top of\n the meeting's agenda. \n\n The first is establishing an industry organization to set the standard terms \nand conditions for trading bandwidth as\n a commodity. The second is setting a North American benchmark for trading. \n\n The bandwidth trading organization, or BTO, should consist of companies \n\"with actual financial risk\" in\n bandwidth trading, Gros said. That means the group would consist mainly of \nmajor telecommunications carriers,\n the bandwidth producers. \n\n But others also have financial risk in bandwidth, he said, including some \nmajor Wall Street players and bandwidth\n consumers. \n\n Gros said some Wall Street players have already begun trading bandwidth, but \nhe wouldn't identify them. A\n source with a Wall Street investment bank, who didn't want to be identified, \nsaid Gros's claim was a stretch. \n\n Banks with trading operations are consumers, using telecommunications \nbandwidth to move stock market and\n commodity trading data internationally among offices, he said. But they \naren't actively trading bandwidth as they\n do established commodities. \n\n Major consumers of bandwidth would include large Internet service providers, \nor ISPs. Gros said they should\n also be included in the BTO. \n\n Before bandwidth can be quickly and easily traded domestically, the market \nneeds a North American benchmark\n that sets technical specifications, Gros said. \n\n In domestic crude oil trading, the benchmark is West Texas Intermediate, \nwhich must meet standards for\n American Petroleum Institute specific gravity and for sulfur content. \n\n In the bandwidth market, standards would be set for quality-of-service \nissues like errored seconds, severely\n errored seconds and unavailable seconds, Gros said. Those standards would \ncover corruption of data\n transmitted over bandwidth as well as the availability of bandwidth. \n\n Enron has suggested that the benchmark cover the route between New York and \nLos Angeles, which ranks\n among the routes with the most data traffic in North America. \n\n Agreeing on standards will be the toughest job to accomplish at the meeting, \nsaid Ken Epps, senior vice\n president for strategic marketing for Williams Communications Group (WCG), \nwhich will also be represented at\n the meeting. \n\n The technical standards for bandwidth trading can't be set so high that they \nlimit the number of companies that\n will trade, Epps said. If the standards limit liquidity, the market won't \ndevelop. \n\n \"Everybody needs to walk away feeling that it's a standard they can live \nwith, that they can build their business\n around,\" Epps said. \n\n That goal can be met - it's just a question of how long it will take, he \nsaid. \"I don't expect it will be settled at the\n first meeting of the CompTel group, but it will be the kickoff.\" \n\n Williams plans to keep those discussion going next month at its own \"carrier \nforum\" to discuss bandwidth trading\n standards, Epps said. \n\n About a year ago, when Enron first proposed trading bandwidth as a \ncommodity, Williams officials were quoted\n as being skeptical about the idea. \n\n But last month, the company announced it would take a leading role in \ndeveloping a market for trading\n bandwidth. The Williams carrier meeting shows that the company is now \nserious about bandwidth trading. \n\n Williams is inviting \"the real players, the MCI WorldComs (WCOM), the Qwests \n(Q), the AT&Ts (T),\" Epps\n said. \"It's about people who have the assets and how we use these to \nadvantage the marketplace, how we build\n a good powerful market model.\" \n\n CompTel's Frisby, Enron's Gros and Williams's Epps wouldn't discuss which \nother companies were attending the\n meeting in Washington. But Dow Jones Newswires was able to obtain a list of \nattendees. \n\n Among the invitees are companies with experience trading energy commodities \n- Dynegy Inc. (DYN); El Paso\n Energy Corp. (EPG); Columbia Transmission Communications, a unit of Columbia \nEnergy Group (CG); and\n Koch Industries, which has investments in energy and telecommunications. \n\n A surprise on the list is MCI WorldCom. Some industry sources have said the \ncompany opposes the idea of\n bandwidth trading under standard terms and conditions. \n\n An industry analyst, who didn't want to be identified, said MCI WorldCom's \nparticipation in the meeting is\n indicative of changing attitudes in the telecom carrier industry about \nbandwidth trading. \n\n Retail marketing groups within telecommunications carrier companies don't \nlike the idea of a liquid bandwidth\n trading market, the analyst said. \n\n Such a market could turn retail customers into wholesale customers. For \nexample, a retail customer like an ISP\n could go to a liquid bandwidth market and buy at wholesale prices, he said. \n\n Also on the attendee list are telecom carriers Teleglobe (TGO) and Global \nCrossing Ltd. (GBLX); NTT\n America, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.; \nand Progress Telecom, a unit\n of the electric utility Florida Progress Corp. (FPC). \n\n Also on the list is recent IPO Universal Access Inc. (UAXS), a company that \nmatches carriers that have excess\n capacity with carriers that need extra capacity. \n\n LighTrade, a start-up company setting up pooling points to allow bandwidth \ntrading, was also invited. \n\n Commodity traders are represented by Sakura Dellscher, Amerex, Prebon \nYamane, AIG Telecom and the New\n York Mercantile Exchange. \n\n Two consulting companies, Andersen Consulting and PricewaterhouseCoopers, \nwere also invited.

The continuous and frequent updating of prices - including the operation \nof the \"Stack Manager\" which automates this process in many ways so that the \nsystem can react more quickly than a person.\n4.  EnronOnline uses multiple levels of contractual language - a single line \n\"short description\" of abbreviated terms identifying the transaction to the \ntrader, a long description which defines the abbreviated terms and adds \nadditional legal language and general terms and conditions which contain the \nremaining contractual terms and are accepted only once by the counterparty.\n5.

As we\ndiscussed last week, the draft is designed to be relatively simple and \"user\nfriendly,\" accommodating a single Enron entity and a single counterparty \nentity\nengaged in cash settled and physically settled transactions under separate,\npre-existing, respective financial and physical master agreements similar to\nthose which you have provided to us as examples.\n\nWe note a few points about the attached draft:\n\n1.   The terms \"master netting agreement\" and \"master netting agreement\nparticipants\" in Section 6 refer to proposed definitions that would be added \nto\nthe Bankruptcy Code upon enactment of the pending legislation. If an agreement\nis executed with a counterparty prior to enactment (or if the legislation is \nnot\nenacted), we would amend this provision to incorporate instead the existing \nsafe\nharbor provisions to the extent possible.\n\n2.  We designated Texas law as the governing law (in brackets) based on the\nprovisions of the ISDA schedule you provided to us.\n\n3.  Notwithstanding that the draft contemplates a single Enron entity, we\nincluded references to Enron affiliates in certain provisions to provide\nflexibility in the event that obligations from other Enron entities to the\ncounterparty should arise in any other context. We think that all such\nobligations should be available for setoff against Enron's claims against the\ncounterparty.\n\nPlease call us when you have had an opportunity to review the draft.\n\n(See attached file: #109563 v2 - master netting agreement.doc)\n\n\n\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|NOTE:  The information in this email is confidential and may be   |\n|legally privileged.

After  working  for  seven  years  on  credit  \nrisk\nmanagement  in  a  research and consulting capacity, I would like to transfer \nmy\nexperience  in  assessing  credit  risk  modeling,  information  technology  \nand\nmethodology  in  complex  top-tier  institutions  to  an  active  credit \ntrading\nmanagerial   environment.   I  am  excited  about  being  involved  in  \ntrading,\norigination, risk management and R&D of credit derivatives.\n\nI  have  seven years of experience in credit risk measurement and \nmanagement.  I\nhave  helped  design,  test  and implement credit value-at-risk systems with \nKMV\nCorp  and  with  a  major  Japanese  bank.   I was a major contributor at KMV \nin\ndesigning the Expected Default Frequency model and I am thoroughly familiar \nwith\nits  assumptions,  strengths,  weaknesses and applications.  I did the \nempirical\nresearch  that  lies  behind the KMV default correlation model, the private \nfirm\nEDF  model  and  I interfaced with J.P. Morgan (now R.M.G.) personnel during \nthe\ncreation of the CreditMetrics documentation.\n\nI  have  excellent analytical, quantitative, statistical and programming \nskills.\nI studied finance extensively when I was a graduate student and I studied \ncredit\nrisk theory while I worked with KMV and Arthur Andersen.

I  am  excited  about  being  involved  in  \ntrading,\norigination, risk management and R&D of credit derivatives.\n\nI  have  seven years of experience in credit risk measurement and \nmanagement.

I was a major contributor at KMV \nin\ndesigning the Expected Default Frequency model and I am thoroughly familiar \nwith\nits  assumptions,  strengths,  weaknesses and applications.  I did the \nempirical\nresearch  that  lies  behind the KMV default correlation model, the private \nfirm\nEDF  model  and  I interfaced with J.P. Morgan (now R.M.G.) personnel during \nthe\ncreation of the CreditMetrics documentation.\n\nI  have  excellent analytical, quantitative, statistical and programming \nskills.\nI studied finance extensively when I was a graduate student and I studied \ncredit\nrisk theory while I worked with KMV and Arthur Andersen.

The paper proposes, among other\nthings, that credit derivatives be included in the definitions of credit risk\narising from securitizations and that the capital charge be based on the\ncredit rating of the underlying obligation. \n\nMerrill Lynch is reorganizing its global debt group and recently appointed\nDow Kim to a new position as head of the newly formed integrated global\nenterprise solutions group. The move is meant to integrate the bank's\npreviously less centralized derivatives businesses. \n\nHanjin Heavy Industries & Construction Co., the South Korea ship\nbuilding and construction giant, is considering its first use of U.S.\ndollar/Korean won currency options and interest-rate swaps. \n\n_________________________ \n\nAs a DW subscriber, you are eligible for complimentary access to the \nSubscribers Only area of the <www.derivativesweek.com> site, which \ncontains the current issue and a searchable archive of all past issues. \nUse your User ID and Password to access the entire site.

Also included is a\ndraft what should be in the L/C and Schedule 1 of a Stby L/C.\n\nPlease note that I have accepted most of the previous changes so the current\nissues would more easily be seen in the draft.\n\nComments concerning the schedule and para 13 are below:  Note - our legal\ncouncil is out this week but I thought I would send this draft to you now,\nand we can make further adjustments, if any, based on our legal department\nreview next week.\n\n1.  Part 1 (e):  After Charles Hofer spoke with your Credit Manager, Brant\nReves, they decided to make the cross default threshold at $100MM for each\ncredit support provider.\n2.  1(h):  Made change per our phone conversation that Market Quotation will\napply for 3 years or less; Loss for over 3 years.\n3.  5(g):  I am confused by this change.  I added back in the word\n\"obligations\" in para B, 5th line and added back in the phrase concerning\naffiliates.  I'm not sure my predecessor deleted them (it is not deleted on\nmy 3/20/00 draft) but I can't imagine who else would.  Two comments (i) do\nyou think this is best way to word this, and (2) my legal council (who is\nout most of this week) will have to review your final wording before we can\nexecute.\n4.  5(l):  Changed the telephone recording paragraph by (a) not limiting it\nto just trading staff and (b) adding \"to the extent permitted by applicable\nlaw\".\n5.  5(n-q):  All new paragraphs that are not part of our standard agreement.\nHowever, these were not discussed in Susan's last memo to you (except the\nadding back in of paragraph q) so I am leaving them as is.\n6.  Part 6:  After reviewing your changes vs. our standard paragraphs, I\nhave no objections to your changes\n7.  13(b)(i)(C) Accepted your definition of Credit Support Amount even\nthough we don't normally use Independent Amounts.\n8.  13(b)(iii)(A)  Letters of Credit - changes days to 20 from 10, per your\nrequest.  After re-reading, I don't understand how it improves the position\nof the secured party.  If the L/C has an expiration date and the secured\nparty attempts to execute (i.e.: cash in) this L/C, then if the L/C is\nwithin 20 days of its expiration, the value can drop to zero.  Before, the\nL/C maintained 100% of its value until 10 days prior to expiration.  Since\nEnron looks at these contracts from the secured party perspective, how does\nyour position improve based on this change?\n8.  13(b)(iii)(B and C) Threshold for both of us has been increased to $50MM\nand Minimum Transfer Amount has been reduced to zero ($0).\n\nFor questions, please call at 713-420-3548 or email me.\n\nThanks!\n\nJohn\n.\n <<Enron Schedule -Draft 5-16.doc>>  <<Enron CSA - Draft 5-16.doc>>\n\n\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: Carol St Clair [SMTP:Carol.St.Clair@enron.com]\n> Sent: Friday, May 12, 2000 5:07 PM\n> To: Shuttee, John\n> Subject: Credit Response\n>\n>\n>\n> Carol St. Clair\n> EB 3892\n> 713-853-3989 (Phone)\n> 713-646-3393 (Fax)\n> ----- Forwarded by Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT on 05/12/2000 05:07 PM -----\n> |--------+----------------------->\n> |        |          Carol St     |\n> |        |          Clair        |\n> |        |                       |\n> |        |          05/12/2000   |\n> |        |          05:02 PM     |\n> |        |                       |\n> |--------+----------------------->\n>\n> >-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n> ---|\n>   |\n> |\n>   |       To:     shuttej@epenergy.com\n> |\n>   |       cc:     Brant Reves/HOU/ECT@ECT\n> |\n>   |       Subject:     Credit Response\n> |\n>\n> >-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n> ---|\n>\n>\n>\n> John:\n> Our credit person has agreed to the 3% equity test for cross-default.\n> With\n> respect to setoff, given our relationships with El Paso, this is an\n> important\n> credit point for us and one that I guess the credit people will need to\n> discuss\n> since it is important for us to have the Affiliate language.

To make a \nlong story short, subsequent to that meeting, they reconvened their committee \nand announced the upgrade.  \n\nI want you to know how critical your contribution was to the discussion and \nwill continue to be as the bar gets raised.  I am sure that next year they \nwill continue to be concerned with our risk management capabilities as well \nas extensions of our current platform - tail risk, intra day risk, \noperational risk, and enterprise wide risk.\n\nThank you for your efforts in supporting RAC - it has tangible benefits.\n\nTed\n\np.s. - there is still lots of interesting opportunities to extend the \nparadigm"

In the financial reporting section, they want to add on our side a \nrequirement that we deliver to them any financial or business report that we \nmake available to our shareholders or that we file with the SEC or bank \nregulatory authorities\n\n5. In the Netting language, they have excluded FX and Currency Option \ntransactions.\n\n6. In the setoff language, they have limited the trigger to the designation \nof an Early Termination date because of the Termination Event Credit Event \nUpon Merger.

In the Termination section where we specify Loss and Second method that \nhave an interesting rider (insert 2) that modifies how the Second Method \nworks.

          "body": "I have received preliminary information from D&B.  I think several \nissues/questions have been raised that if explored, could result in a better \nsolution for the money.  \n\nOption 1\nThe update frequency for our current file can be improved from quarterly to \nmonthly for a cost of $87,000 (USD) through March, 2001.\n\nOption 2\nI wasn't sure what specific data in the file you might be interested in.  If \nyou are particularly interested in the Financial Stress Score and Credit \nScore, for example, there are multiple alternatives :\n \n 2a) Keep quartlery refresh of base data (party name, etc) and refresh scores \nthat are added/changed on a monthly basis.  Cost - $1.17(USD) per \nrecord.          Note that there are 575,000 records in the file currently \nwith financial and credit scores, making this potentially a very expensive \nalternative \n        (575,000 X 1.17=$ 672,750).\n\n 2b) Batch or FTP updates of the financial and stress scores can only be \nprovided monthly.  D&B is working on a solution that would provide a \nweekly         update to their customers in a batch or FTP manner, but has \nnot committed to when this will be ready.  Therefore, if more timely updates \nthan monthly                          are desired, it is also possible to \ntransactionally access records one at a time using D&B's software.  The cost \nfor this is extremely high at $10.52         (USD) per score. \n\nOption 3\nD&B Connect Product.\n D&B Connect is a tool set of matching software, an externally validated \nreference file, credit and marketing information, and D&B services that \nenables the  most effective integration of customer information and \nthird-party information with D&B information.  Only this type of process and \ninformation integration  capability can facilitate and ensure accurate \nidentification, linkage and maintenance of your customer's complete \nrelationship.   In addition, D&B Connect  assures organizations of \nreferential integrity by providing an automated and electronic link to D&B so \nthat the most recent D&B information is always  transmitted to your \norganization and updated within your local D&B Connect Reference File.  D&B \nConnect is scalable.  \n\n Cost Typically ranging from\n * Customer Access Module (CAM) Batch- - $25,000\n * CAM Online - $50,000\n * Full Information Integrator - $350,000 + data\n\nWith more specifics as to your needs, this option should perhaps be pursued.\n\n\nQuestions/Issues\n\n1) D&B had questions regarding the use of their data and whether Enron \ncustomers would be offered this information for a fee or free.  I explained \nthat I  did not feel the data would be offered directly to Enron customers, \nbut that it would be used to support analysis that would be available \nexternally via web  site, etc.  All pricing above is based upon this \nunderstanding.  If I have not portrayed the usage correctly, it will be \nimperative to get a better understanding  before final pricing can be \nnegotiated.\n\n2)  Are there specific data elements that you are interested in ?  \nAlternatives may vary by data element.  Financial Stress Score and Credit \nScore reference  above were explored as an example.\n\n3)  What is timeframe for needing a solution ?\n\n4)  Financial Stress Score and Credit Score are only available on U.S. \ncompanies.  A comparable measure - Global Failure Score (the liklihood of \ndefault or  bankruptcy)  is available for international companies.  This \nrating score however, is NOT currently available via a batch or FTP manner.  \nThis could result  in additional cost if we wish to pursue obtaining this \nscore in a batch manner.\n\n5)  Pricing also varies whether the information is to be used for credit \nanalysis or risk management decisions versus for marketing purposes.  This is \nprobably  negotiable as the data is the same.  The thought process is that if \nthe repository is used for credit or risk decisions, D&B will see decreased \nusage and  revenue on a transactional basis by the credit departments.\n\n If you would like me to follow up further, please give me a call at \n713-853-6079.\n\n"

In the cross-default language that want to add language that basically \nsays that even if a cross-default occurs, unless the Non-Defaulting \ndetermines in good faith that performance by the Defaulting Party of its \nobligations under the Master is \"endangered\", then no cross default is \ntriggered.\n\n2. In Credit Event Upon Merger we had commented that instaed of the \n\"materially weaker\" standard we wanted to specify that it meant being rated \nbelow BBB- by S&P.  Do you feel strongly about this?  Alos, we usually have \nlanguage that says that if an event like merger occurs and the transferee \nprovides collateral to the other party in an amount that is satisfactory to \nsuch party, then a Credit Event Upon Merger is not triggered.  They did not \nwant to add this carve-out.  Are you okay with this?\n\n3. They want a separate Event of Default that gets triggered if a MAC (below \nBBB-) occurs.  We requested that it be out in the collateral threshold \nlanguage.\n\n4. They are saying that for \"operational\" purposes, they cannot agree to \n\"netting\".\n\n5. They want as a category of Eligible Collateral governmental securities \nwith a maturity of less than 1 year, valued at 98%.\n\n6. In the CSA, if a dispute occurs with respect to either the calculation of \nExposure or the calculation of the value of any colateral in connection with \na party's request either for the transfer or return of collateral, normally \nthe following procedures apply:\n\na. the disputing party notifies the other party of the nature of the dispute \nby the close of business on the day following the day that the collateral \nrequest was made.\n\nb. the undisputed amount is transferred to the party making the request\n\nc. the parties attempt to resolve the dispute by the \"Resolution Time\" and if \na resolution is not reached, a recalculation of the Exposure is made and \nmarket quotations have to be obtained.\n\nWe normally say that the Resolution Time is 3 Business Days after the dispute \nnotice is given.  DB wants to shorten this period to 1 Business Day after the \ndispute notice is given which gives the parties less time to resolve the \ndispute on their own.  What do you think?\n\n7. If a party holds cash as collateral, we normally say that interest earned \nis transferred on the first day of the month.  They want to change first to \nlast.\n\nLet me know what you think.  I was hoping that some of these you could \nresolve with your counterpart at DB.\n\nCarol  \n"

Cross default threshold - instead of $100,000,000 they want a 3% of equity \ntest.\n\n2. Credit Event Upon Merger - they want to delete the amendment language in \nour Schedule\n\n3. MAC Trigger - this currently is an Event of Default.  They want to make it \na Termination Event.  Also, they want to add to the trigger going below a \nBaa3 rating by Moody's.\n\n4.  In the financial reporting section, they want to add on our side a \nrequirement that we deliver to them any financial or business report that we \nmake available to our shareholders or that we file with the SEC or bank \nregulatory authorities\n\n5. In the Netting language, they have excluded FX and Currency Option \ntransactions.\n\n6. In the setoff language, they have limited the trigger to the designation \nof an Early Termination date because of the Termination Event Credit Event \nUpon Merger.  Alos, they want setoff to apply to \"matured and unmatured\" \nobligations.\n\n7. They don't want a cap on the Enron Guaranty\n\n8. In the Termination section where we specify Loss and Second method that \nhave an interesting rider (insert 2) that modifies how the Second Method \nworks.

          "body": "Thank you for keeping us in the loop on this.  D&B data will become one of \nour most important sources.  As you suggest, the intent is to use this data \nalong with other available date to generate a price for credit.  The price \nwill be published externally (likely for a fee and as a free service) via the \nweb or via automated processes.  \n\nOption 3 appears to be the best solution for us given our desire for as up to \ndate data as possible.  Stuart is working with the credit team to define \nadditional data elements but the credit score and financial score are likely \nwhat we are looking for.  Alternatively, if it is possible to obtain the \nactual data that is used to generate the score that would allow us to \ngenerate our own score in addition to D&B's.  We will need the Global Failure \nScore as well.  Currently we are active in Europe as well as the US and \nexpect to move towards Asia and Austrailia over time.  Hopefully, this data \nis available via D&B Connect.\n\nAnother consideration is the term of contract.  We would likely prefer a \nlonger term contract so that if they decide they don't like what we are doing \nwith the data, we cannot be cut off.  Does it make sense from your \nperspective to approach D&B to be our long term, strategic providor of \ncustomer data.  This would likely make their deal maker look good in his \nboss's eyes, give you lot's of negotiating ability and give a us the long \nterm preferential contract that we are looking for.\n\nLet's discuss further.\n\nbryan\n\n\n\n\n\nMary Solmonson\n05/05/2000 19:25\nTo: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Bryan Seyfried/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Philippe A Bibi/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stuart \nFfoulkes/LON/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: Dun & Bradstreet Info for Credit Trading\n\nI have received preliminary information from D&B.  I think several \nissues/questions have been raised that if explored, could result in a better \nsolution for the money.  \n\nOption 1\nThe update frequency for our current file can be improved from quarterly to \nmonthly for a cost of $87,000 (USD) through March, 2001.\n\nOption 2\nI wasn't sure what specific data in the file you might be interested in.  If \nyou are particularly interested in the Financial Stress Score and Credit \nScore, for example, there are multiple alternatives :\n \n 2a) Keep quartlery refresh of base data (party name, etc) and refresh scores \nthat are added/changed on a monthly basis.  Cost - $1.17(USD) per \nrecord.          Note that there are 575,000 records in the file currently \nwith financial and credit scores, making this potentially a very expensive \nalternative \n        (575,000 X 1.17=$ 672,750).\n\n 2b) Batch or FTP updates of the financial and stress scores can only be \nprovided monthly.  D&B is working on a solution that would provide a \nweekly         update to their customers in a batch or FTP manner, but has \nnot committed to when this will be ready.  Therefore, if more timely updates \nthan monthly                          are desired, it is also possible to \ntransactionally access records one at a time using D&B's software.  The cost \nfor this is extremely high at $10.52         (USD) per score. \n\nOption 3\nD&B Connect Product.\n D&B Connect is a tool set of matching software, an externally validated \nreference file, credit and marketing information, and D&B services that \nenables the  most effective integration of customer information and \nthird-party information with D&B information.  Only this type of process and \ninformation integration  capability can facilitate and ensure accurate \nidentification, linkage and maintenance of your customer's complete \nrelationship.   In addition, D&B Connect  assures organizations of \nreferential integrity by providing an automated and electronic link to D&B so \nthat the most recent D&B information is always  transmitted to your \norganization and updated within your local D&B Connect Reference File.  D&B \nConnect is scalable.  \n\n Cost Typically ranging from\n * Customer Access Module (CAM) Batch- - $25,000\n * CAM Online - $50,000\n * Full Information Integrator - $350,000 + data\n\nWith more specifics as to your needs, this option should perhaps be pursued.\n\n\nQuestions/Issues\n\n1) D&B had questions regarding the use of their data and whether Enron \ncustomers would be offered this information for a fee or free.  I explained \nthat I  did not feel the data would be offered directly to Enron customers, \nbut that it would be used to support analysis that would be available \nexternally via web  site, etc.  All pricing above is based upon this \nunderstanding.  If I have not portrayed the usage correctly, it will be \nimperative to get a better understanding  before final pricing can be \nnegotiated.\n\n2)  Are there specific data elements that you are interested in ?  \nAlternatives may vary by data element.  Financial Stress Score and Credit \nScore reference  above were explored as an example.\n\n3)  What is timeframe for needing a solution ?\n\n4)  Financial Stress Score and Credit Score are only available on U.S. \ncompanies.  A comparable measure - Global Failure Score (the liklihood of \ndefault or  bankruptcy)  is available for international companies.  This \nrating score however, is NOT currently available via a batch or FTP manner.  \nThis could result  in additional cost if we wish to pursue obtaining this \nscore in a batch manner.\n\n5)  Pricing also varies whether the information is to be used for credit \nanalysis or risk management decisions versus for marketing purposes.  This is \nprobably  negotiable as the data is the same.  The thought process is that if \nthe repository is used for credit or risk decisions, D&B will see decreased \nusage and  revenue on a transactional basis by the credit departments.\n\n If you would like me to follow up further, please give me a call at \n713-853-6079.\n\n\n\n\n"

In the cross-default language that want to add language that basically \nsays that even if a cross-default occurs, unless the Non-Defaulting \ndetermines in good faith that performance by the Defaulting Party of its \nobligations under the Master is \"endangered\", then no cross default is \ntriggered.\n\n2. In Credit Event Upon Merger we had commented that instaed of the \n\"materially weaker\" standard we wanted to specify that it meant being rated \nbelow BBB- by S&P.  Do you feel strongly about this?  Alos, we usually have \nlanguage that says that if an event like merger occurs and the transferee \nprovides collateral to the other party in an amount that is satisfactory to \nsuch party, then a Credit Event Upon Merger is not triggered.  They did not \nwant to add this carve-out.  Are you okay with this?\n\n3. They want a separate Event of Default that gets triggered if a MAC (below \nBBB-) occurs.  We requested that it be out in the collateral threshold \nlanguage.\n\n4. They are saying that for \"operational\" purposes, they cannot agree to \n\"netting\".\n\n5. They want as a category of Eligible Collateral governmental securities \nwith a maturity of less than 1 year, valued at 98%.\n\n6. In the CSA, if a dispute occurs with respect to either the calculation of \nExposure or the calculation of the value of any colateral in connection with \na party's request either for the transfer or return of collateral, normally \nthe following procedures apply:\n\na. the disputing party notifies the other party of the nature of the dispute \nby the close of business on the day following the day that the collateral \nrequest was made.\n\nb. the undisputed amount is transferred to the party making the request\n\nc. the parties attempt to resolve the dispute by the \"Resolution Time\" and if \na resolution is not reached, a recalculation of the Exposure is made and \nmarket quotations have to be obtained.\n\nWe normally say that the Resolution Time is 3 Business Days after the dispute \nnotice is given.  DB wants to shorten this period to 1 Business Day after the \ndispute notice is given which gives the parties less time to resolve the \ndispute on their own.  What do you think?\n\n7. If a party holds cash as collateral, we normally say that interest earned \nis transferred on the first day of the month.  They want to change first to \nlast.\n\nLet me know what you think.  I was hoping that some of these you could \nresolve with your counterpart at DB.\n\nCarol  "

Perhaps we could agree that we will do it and you get your 10%\nin each entity now, but that the actual technology link doesn't start until\nlater this year?\n\nRegards,\nFrank\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Louise.Kitchen@enron.com [mailto:Louise.Kitchen@enron.com]\nSent: Tuesday, May 16, 2000 4:26 PM\nTo: fgetman@houstonstreet.com\nCc: Louise.Kitchen@enron.com; fgetman@houstonstreet.com;\nmark.taylor@enron.com; dave.samuels@enron.com; Andy.Zipper@enron.com\nSubject: RE: Follow-up on Friday's meeting\n\n\n\nI thought the European/Japan 10% was done ie if we put products we get 10%,\nie an option we could decide on later.\n\nAny idea also on the financial date as our guys do not think we can make\nany volume targets without it.

Your list for power and gas products are fine. I\nagree we can add products/markets going forward as appropriate.  We also\ndiscussed posting your numbers for crude and products.  I believe we agreed\ncrude and products would not be part of any volume targets, but that we\nwould incorporate those products in the first round.  Please provide me a\nlist for crude and products based on what we offer on HoustonStreet.  Also,\nany thoughts on whether you want to take me up on my offer to include your\nnumbers in Europe (UK, Germany and Scandanavia) and Japan for an additional\n10% equity in each of those markets?  The reason I ask is that we are\nengaged in liquidity partner discussions right now and your answer might\naffect our decisions.  We are on target to go live in Europe this Summer.\n\nAs for corporate docs, we are prepared to deliver whatever you need to see\nwhenever it is appropriate.

I think we\nmade good progress -- by the end of the day, Louise and I were able to\nresolve most, if not all, major items.  Late on Friday, Kevin Sluder from\nmy\noffice forwarded to Louise by email a list of the proposed markets on\nHoustonStreet for which we would look to receive prices electronically from\nEnronOnline.  Louise indicated that you would attempt to have a draft\nagreement available late in the day on Monday or Tuesday morning.  I wanted\nto confirm this timing so I can make sure I have the appropriate\nindividuals\non my end ready to turn it around.  I think it is in everyone's interest to\ntry to push this forward this week.\n\nPlease let me know if you need any additional information from\nHoustonStreet.\n\nBest regards,\nFrank Getman\nfgetman@houstonstreet.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

We cannot agree to the additional language in the cross-default \nprovision.  We need a trigger that is not subject to interpretation and \nsecond-guessing and the language that you proposed does just that.  \n\n2. On credit event upon merger, we would prefer to define the standard for \n\"materially weaker\" as below investment grade.  Is that a problem for you?\n\n3. With respect to payment netting, we would prefer that netting apply to \nTransactions that are of the same product line (i.e. all commodity swaps).  \nIs that a problem for you?  We thought that your operational issue had to do \nmore with netting across product lines.\n\n4. In the Credit Support Annex, we would prefer that the number of days to \nresolve disputes over exposure and/or value be 2 business days instead of 1.  \n\nI am in the process of reviewing the new drafts of ISDA and CSA Schedules and \nwill get back to you shortly on remaining comments.\n\nCarol"

I have already discussed with Houston Credit Risk Management & Research \nthe possibility of allocation of risk protection on a name basis; at this \npoint in time there has been no resolution in finding an appropriate way to \nallocate protection by name.\n\nSummary of insurance:\nEnron absorbs the first $10mm of losses in any one year capped at the \naggregate of $30mm over a ten year period.\nAEGIS absorbs the next $35mm of losses for the same ten year period. \nChubb will pick up the next $50mm losses for any single event and $100mm in \nlosses in the aggregate for 5 years\nRSA takes the next $50mm for losses in excess of $95mm over a five year \nperiod & covers the top 9 counterparties by exposure\n\nRegards,\n\nSoma\n\n\n\n\nJohn Sherriff\n03/03/2000 18:16\nTo: Soma Ghosh/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \n\nSubject: Re: Eastern  \n\nSoma\n\nHow does the company's credit insurance (done by Houston last year) affect \nthis exposure?\n\nJohn\n\n\n\nSoma Ghosh\n03/03/2000 16:24\nTo: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: David Weekes/LON/ECT@ECT, Steve W Young/LON/ECT@ECT, Barry \nPearce/LON/ECT@ECT, Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT, William S \nBradford/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Oliver Gaylard/LON/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: Re: Eastern\n\nPlease note that Total Exposure $ number is $979.8mm NOT $783.2mm.\n\nApologies,\n\nSoma\n---------------------- Forwarded by Soma Ghosh/LON/ECT on 03/03/2000 16:22 \n---------------------------\n\n\nSoma Ghosh\n03/03/2000 16:17\nTo: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: David Weekes/LON/ECT@ECT, Steve W Young/LON/ECT@ECT, Barry \nPearce/LON/ECT@ECT, Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT, William S \nBradford/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rick Buy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Oliver Gaylard/LON/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: Re: Eastern  \n\nJohn, as requested:\n\nTotal exposure as at 29 Feb 2000:    o620.9mm ($783.2mm)\nEurocash I monetezation:    -o124.7mm (-$196.1mm)\nLess credit derivatives:         o40.0mm ($63.1mm)\nTotal Net Exposure as at 29 Feb 2000:  o456.2mm ($713.9mm) \nNet  month on month increase:    o125.4mm ($197.9mm)\n\nTotal Value of Eastern Group Guarantee:  o520mm ($820.6mm)\nAmount backed by TXU:    Zero\n\nAs well as the increase in overall exposure, please note the change in shape \nof the exposure month on month most notably credit exposure now peaking at \nthe front end of the transaction (ex credit derivs. the max exposure is at \nday 1), compare to max. exp. at Feb 2005  for month end Jan.. \nShape of profile & increase in MtM primarily due to:\n - Power curve downward shift at front end yrs 0-11\n - Power curve upward shift at back end yrs 12-18\n - Gas curve upward shift yrs 1-5. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I'm not sure my predecessor deleted them (it is not deleted on\nmy 3/20/00 draft) but I can't imagine who else would.  Two comments (i) do\nyou think this is best way to word this, and (2) my legal council (who is\nout most of this week) will have to review your final wording before we can\nexecute.\n4.  5(l):  Changed the telephone recording paragraph by (a) not limiting it\nto just trading staff and (b) adding \"to the extent permitted by applicable\nlaw\".\n5.  5(n-q):  All new paragraphs that are not part of our standard agreement.\nHowever, these were not discussed in Susan's last memo to you (except the\nadding back in of paragraph q) so I am leaving them as is.\n6.  Part 6:  After reviewing your changes vs. our standard paragraphs, I\nhave no objections to your changes\n7.  13(b)(i)(C) Accepted your definition of Credit Support Amount even\nthough we don't normally use Independent Amounts.\n8.  13(b)(iii)(A)  Letters of Credit - changes days to 20 from 10, per your\nrequest.  After re-reading, I don't understand how it improves the position\nof the secured party.  If the L/C has an expiration date and the secured\nparty attempts to execute (i.e.: cash in) this L/C, then if the L/C is\nwithin 20 days of its expiration, the value can drop to zero.  Before, the\nL/C maintained 100% of its value until 10 days prior to expiration.  Since\nEnron looks at these contracts from the secured party perspective, how does\nyour position improve based on this change?\n8.  13(b)(iii)(B and C) Threshold for both of us has been increased to $50MM\nand Minimum Transfer Amount has been reduced to zero ($0).\n\nFor questions, please call at 713-420-3548 or email me.\n\nThanks!\n\nJohn\n.\n <<Enron Schedule -Draft 5-16.doc>>  <<Enron CSA - Draft 5-16.doc>>\n\n\n\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: Carol St Clair [SMTP:Carol.St.Clair@enron.com]\n> Sent: Friday, May 12, 2000 5:07 PM\n> To: Shuttee, John\n> Subject: Credit Response\n>\n>\n>\n> Carol St. Clair\n> EB 3892\n> 713-853-3989 (Phone)\n> 713-646-3393 (Fax)\n> ----- Forwarded by Carol St Clair/HOU/ECT on 05/12/2000 05:07 PM -----\n> |--------+----------------------->\n> |        |          Carol St     |\n> |        |          Clair        |\n> |        |                       |\n> |        |          05/12/2000   |\n> |        |          05:02 PM     |\n> |        |                       |\n> |--------+----------------------->\n>\n> >-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n> ---|\n>   |\n> |\n>   |       To:     shuttej@epenergy.com\n> |\n>   |       cc:     Brant Reves/HOU/ECT@ECT\n> |\n>   |       Subject:     Credit Response\n> |\n>\n> >-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n> ---|\n>\n>\n>\n> John:\n> Our credit person has agreed to the 3% equity test for cross-default.\n> With\n> respect to setoff, given our relationships with El Paso, this is an\n> important\n> credit point for us and one that I guess the credit people will need to\n> discuss\n> since it is important for us to have the Affiliate language.

I know Rob has been working on    mitigation plans;\n b) Commercial Objections: (>$67M)\n  - Paper - Edward ($27M) - The report shows a number of commerical \nobjections to calling for collateral ie) Repap,  Times Mirror and Waste   \nMgt. Can you give me a call to discuss - we may need documentation to support;\n  - Gas/Mid-Mkt - Jeff ($29M)- Do you own Cross Timbers Oil Co, Torch Energy, \nAurora Natural Gas, Seneca Resource Corp and Cody Energy?   We have in these \ncases additional commercial objections to calling for collateral - lets \ndiscuss;\n  - Mariner  ($9M)- Ray we are showing a collateral need of approx. $9.0M - \ngiven our equity position this may be moot;however, lets discuss.\n c) Margin Call (>$51M) - Rick/Bill - have we been successful in getting the \nmargin posted by Sempra, Statoil and Duke?\n\nCanada is a tricky issue; however, we should be able to work down the \ncommercial objections and collect on the margin calls to get the number down. \n\nRegards\nDelainey\n\n\n\n"

The online \"making of a market\" i.e. the continuous posting of real-time \nprices for both purchases and sales of commodities\n2.  The online ability to enter into an energy commodity or commodity \nderivative transaction.\n3.  The continuous and frequent updating of prices - including the operation \nof the \"Stack Manager\" which automates this process in many ways so that the \nsystem can react more quickly than a person.\n4.  EnronOnline uses multiple levels of contractual language - a single line \n\"short description\" of abbreviated terms identifying the transaction to the \ntrader, a long description which defines the abbreviated terms and adds \nadditional legal language and general terms and conditions which contain the \nremaining contractual terms and are accepted only once by the counterparty.\n5.  The site directs counterparties to different contracts based on the \ncounterparty profile containing both credit information and information \nconcerning the contracts the counterparty already has in place.\n6.  It may be relevant for any or all of the foregoing that the EnronOnline \nsystem is web-based - i.e. the user does not require any system-specific \nsoftware but just a web browser (and an internet plug-in application)\n7.  The Master User account gives the counterparty the ability to set up \npasswords for sub-users for that entity and control the access and trading \nauthority of various password holders.\n8.  Each user can create customized screens showing only those products in \nwhich he or she is interested.\n9.  The system provides for the submission of offers to transact by \ncounterparties which are automatically accepted or rejected by the system \nbased on pre-established criteria resulting in binding contracts.\n\nMark Taylor\n\n\n   \n\tEnron North America Corp.\n\t\n\tFrom:  Mark E Haedicke                           04/18/2000 04:52 PM\n\t\n\nTo: Travis McCullough/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sborgman@velaw.com, Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \nSubject: Business Methods on Paper.com\n\n\nBased on earlier conversations, I have identified the following business \nmethods that may be novel from a patent point of view:\n\n1.   our site is offering \"prime\" paper rather than seconds or ends\n2.   credit risk is managed by the site (credit intermediation) without cost \nto customers\n3.   customers can access financial derivatives on paper to manage price risk \non physical paper products\n4.   customers have access to financial derivatives to manage price risk on \nprime offerings\n\nPlease give me your comments on this so we plan our strategy.\n\nMark Haedicke\n\n"

In Credit Event Upon Merger we had commented that instaed of the \n\"materially weaker\" standard we wanted to specify that it meant being rated \nbelow BBB- by S&P.  Do you feel strongly about this?  Alos, we usually have \nlanguage that says that if an event like merger occurs and the transferee \nprovides collateral to the other party in an amount that is satisfactory to \nsuch party, then a Credit Event Upon Merger is not triggered.  They did not \nwant to add this carve-out.  Are you okay with this?\n\n3. They want a separate Event of Default that gets triggered if a MAC (below \nBBB-) occurs.  We requested that it be out in the collateral threshold \nlanguage.\n\n4. They are saying that for \"operational\" purposes, they cannot agree to \n\"netting\".\n\n5. They want as a category of Eligible Collateral governmental securities \nwith a maturity of less than 1 year, valued at 98%.\n\n6. In the CSA, if a dispute occurs with respect to either the calculation of \nExposure or the calculation of the value of any colateral in connection with \na party's request either for the transfer or return of collateral, normally \nthe following procedures apply:\n\na. the disputing party notifies the other party of the nature of the dispute \nby the close of business on the day following the day that the collateral \nrequest was made.\n\nb. the undisputed amount is transferred to the party making the request\n\nc. the parties attempt to resolve the dispute by the \"Resolution Time\" and if \na resolution is not reached, a recalculation of the Exposure is made and \nmarket quotations have to be obtained.\n\nWe normally say that the Resolution Time is 3 Business Days after the dispute \nnotice is given.  DB wants to shorten this period to 1 Business Day after the \ndispute notice is given which gives the parties less time to resolve the \ndispute on their own.  What do you think?\n\n7. If a party holds cash as collateral, we normally say that interest earned \nis transferred on the first day of the month.  They want to change first to \nlast.\n\nLet me know what you think.  I was hoping that some of these you could \nresolve with your counterpart at DB.\n\nCarol  "

The reduced\nemissions will be in place as soon as 2003, according to Massachusetts\nGovernor Paul Cellucci's (R) office.\n\n     The state approached the six plants and asked them to either reduce\ntheir emissions or face regulatory action by the Department of\nEnvironmental Protection. Cellucci said, \"We challenged these power plants\nto clean up their act, and they have answered our call to meet the most\ncomprehensive air emissions standards in the United States.\"\n\n     The agreement -- which the five operators of the six plants agreed\nto with the state -- is voluntary, but enforceable rules will follow.\n\n     Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift explained that the agreement\nresulted through \"cooperative efforts,\" but added, \"We will pursue new\nregulations through the Department of Environmental Protection to ensure\nthe plant owners' commitments are enforceable, and will require the\nfinalization of a detailed plan for each of the six facilities.\"\n\n     The regulations, which are expected to be proposed in the next few\nmonths -- will set standards of 1.5 ponds of nitrogen oxide and 3 pounds of\nsulfur dioxide per megawatt-hour.\n\n     The five companies -- including Sithe Energies, Inc., NRG Energy\nInc., PE&E, Western Massachusetts Electric Companies/ Northeast Utilities,\nand Southern Company/Southern Energy New England, LLC -- have submitted\npreliminary plans. Under the plans, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide\nemissions would be slashed by up to 50 percent, and mercury, particulate\nand carbon dioxide pollution would be curbed.\n\n     \"Our Air Quality Improvement Plan demonstrates that environmental\nexcellence works in today's competitive market,\" said James McGowan, senior\nvice president of Sithe. \"This is a win-win program that will produce the\nbest power plant for Sithe, the local communities and the environment as a\nwhole.\"\n\n     The statement counters many other utilities' position on the issue,\nparticularly the Midwestern coal-fired plants subject to a massive EPA\nenforcement action initiated late last year to have the facilities use\nupgraded pollution control technology. Specifically, the lawsuit charges\nthe utilities with noncompliance with New Source Review requirements of the\nClean Air Act.\n\n     The Massachusetts situation \"does undercut the arguments of\ndirtier, Midwestern companies that claim it can't be done,\" said Frank\nO'Donnell, with Clean Air Trust.\n\n     Pat Hemlepp, spokesperson for American Electric Power, one of the\nutilities involved in the EPA lawsuit, argued, however, \"that is like\ncomparing apples to oranges.\"\n\n     Though Northeastern states blame the Midwest for pollution\nmigrating in their air, Hemlepp explained that since there are no serious\nproblems with non-attainment with CAA regulation in the Midwest, stricter\ncontrols on utilities operating in that part of the country are\nunnecessary. \"States like Massachusetts have every right to go in and ask\nutilities within their state to upgrade. There are major non-attainment\nproblems in the Northeast, so it makes sense,\" Hemlepp argued.\n\n     And about EPA's lawsuit, \"What people overlook is that EPA's\nlawsuit is not about emissions, it's about what is and isn't legal under\nthe Clean Air Act. ... We feel very strongly that what we've done is\nlegal,\" Hemlepp said. \n"

          "body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 04/28/2000 \n02:38 PM ---------------------------\n\n\nRobert Brooks <rebrooks@earthlink.net> on 04/28/2000 12:11:11 PM\nPlease respond to \"rebrooks@rbac.com\" <rebrooks@rbac.com>\nTo: \"'GPCM Distribution'\" <rebrooks@rbac.com>\ncc:  \nSubject: Can Supply Grow Fast Enough to Meet Increased Demand?\n\n\nFor GPCM Modelers from http://www.enerfax.com:\n\n\nNatural Gas Supply Chasing  Demand\n\n    Natural gas suppliers face a tough challenge in meeting strong growth in\ndemand in the near future, experts told an industry conference in Houston\nyesterday. The MMS and the National Petroleum Council have projected that\ndemand for natural gas could rise to 30 Tcf a year by 2010 from current\nlevels of 22 Tcf. Finding and delivering enough natural gas to meet such an\nincrease, even if demand takes another ten years to reach such levels, will\nbe not be easy, the conference was told. The Gulf of Mexico currently\nprovides about a quarter of the nation's natural gas requirements and is\nexpected to generate the majority of future production growth. The MMS says\nthat natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico would likely rise from\nabout 5 Tcf a year now to a peak of 6.1 Tcf in 2005 and then start to\ndecline.  At best, production would peak at 6.7 Tcf in 2010 then bedin to\ndecline. Chevron says that to meet demand of 30 Tcf by 2020, average daily\ngas production in the Gulf of Mexico would have to rise to 22 Bcf cubic feet\nfrom about 14 Bcf now. The GRI says it expects the Gulf of Mexico and Canada\nto be 'key pillars' in meeting US demand for natural gas. The GRI projects\nthat Gulf of Mexico production can reach 8 Tcf a year by 2015, while Canadian\nimports will rise to 4 Tcf a year from 3 Tcf. Over the same period the GRI\nforecasts that supply in the lower 48 states can grow by 5.7 Tcf, with the\nRocky Mountains region contributing a third of the increase. Ziff Energy said\nplanners and forecasters might be taking too pessimistic a view of production\ndecline rates from mature gas wells in the shallow waters of the Gulf of\nMexico. Those wells usually show a rapid decline in production in the early\nyears of their life but then they tend to maintain stable output for\nrelatively long periods. Also, the MMS said new technologies such as\ngas-to-liquid conversion, could help to harness stranded gas in remote\nlocations where pipeline systems cannot be built. Storage will also play an\nincreasingly important role.\n\n\nOffshore Drillers Beginning to Recover\n\n    The offshore oil and natural gas drilling sector has enjoyed a modest\nupturn in fortunes for the first quarter, but their mood remains far from\njubilant as earnings lag well behind the peak levels of 1998. The benefits of\nthe strong recovery in oil prices over the past year have been slow to\ntrickle down to drilling contractors because most large producers have not\nraised their drilling budgets. Over the last week most US drilling companies\nhave reported sharp earnings declines for the first quarter of 2000, compared\nto a year ago. However, many of them posted better numbers than in the final\nquarter of 1999 and even managed to better Wall Street's estimates of\nearnings per share by a few cents. Although earnings are still showing scant\nupward momentum, their stock prices have performed strongly since last year\nin anticipation of a gradual improvement. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange\noilfield services index, rose 66.8% in 1999 and is up another 31% so far this\nyear. So far, the recovery has been largely confined to the shallow waters of\nthe Gulf of Mexico, fueled by a scramble to produce more natural gas.\nDay-rates for Gulf of Mexico jackups have risen 30% compared with the final\nquarter of 1999, with utilization rising to 99% from 87%. Day-rates for\njackups in the North Sea and Asia, however, have fallen with utilization of\ndown to 77% from 81%.\n\nBob Brooks\nGPCM Natural Gas Market Forecasting System\n\n\n"

However, this may alter \nthe way we articulate the relative liquidity of our positions to banks and \nratings agencies.  De facto, we will be saying that our balance sheet and \nincome statement reflect an ability to liquidate gas and power in North \nAmerica at the mid with no adverse effects.  While this may be true, \ntypically these types of institutions see the result of liquidating much more \nliquid portfolios, i.e., they will not believe that we have perfect \nliquidity.  I believe that we can satisfy both accounting and credit \nconsiderations if we maintain an ability to calculate an \"orderly \nliquidation\" under a negative pricing scenario (basically, multiple horizon \nVAR against a liquidating position).  This is what we showed Moody's last \nmonth.  The main difference is that the resulting number will be a hit to p&l \nas opposed to having reserves against it.  This is a long way of saying that \nI think it would be a good idea to discuss prudency methodology with both RAC \nand Treasury once you have finalized a course of action.\nTed "

Although the snowball has just\nstarted rolling, current plans by natural storage operators will boost\nworking capacity by 430 Bcf, or 10%, and will raise peak-day deliverability\n11.8 Bcf per day, or 13.8%, according to a new survey by Intelligence Press.\nIntelligence Press' new multimedia research package provides a comprehensive\nlook at all current activity on 458 storage fields with additional key\ninformation on 101 LNG facilities. Among them are 38 proposed natural gas\nstorage fields and 15 storage expansion projects. Depleted fields capture the\nlargest share of the proposed fields with 24, followed by aquifers with six,\nand salt domes and salt beds with four each. Altogether the proposed new\nfields account for about 329 Bcf in working capacity and 9.7 Bcf per day in\ndeliverability.  Proposed and potential expansions represent an increase of\nabout 100.5 Bcf of working capacity and 2.1 Bcf per day in deliverability.\nBut these projects are just the tip of the iceberg. Regulatory changes,\nshifting natural gas flows and increases in demand due to growth in the\neconomy and particularly in natural gas fired power generation are expected\nto cause significant additional storage growth in the next decade.

The new service will \ninclude the unloading of LNG from tankers, LNG storage, vaporization, and \ndelivery of natural gas to points along Cove Point's existing pipeline.   \n\nCove Point LNG is offering 750,000 dekatherms per day of deliverability and \n4.25 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of vapor equivalent storage capacity initially. \nThe service includes a proposed expansion of the available storage capacity \nto 6.75 Bcf approximately one year after the start-up of the LNG receiving \noperations. Pending approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, \nCove Point LNG plans to begin the LNG tanker discharging service by late \n2001. \n\nLocated in Lusby, Md., the Cove Point LNG terminal includes liquefied natural \ngas storage and terminal operations, and an 87-mile natural gas pipeline that \nconnects with gas pipelines in Northern Virginia. The terminal has installed \nsend-out capacity of 1 Bcf of gas per day. With the proposed storage \nexpansion, total LNG storage at Cove Point will be 7.5 Bcf of vapor \nequivalent natural gas. The Cove Point LNG terminal currently provides \"peak \nshaving\" services to customers in the mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions.  \n\nColumbia Energy Group, based in Herndon, Va., is one of the nation's leading \nenergy services companies, with assets of approximately $7 billion. Its \noperating companies engage in virtually all phases of the natural gas \nbusiness, including exploration and production, transmission, storage and \ndistribution, as well as retail energy marketing, propane and petroleum \nproduct sales, and electric power generation. Information about Columbia \nEnergy Group (NYSE: CG) is available on the Internet at \nwww.columbiaenergygroup.com.   \n\nThis press release contains \"forward looking statements\" within the meaning \nof the Federal securities laws, including statements concerning, on a \nconsolidated, segment or subsidiary basis, Columbia's plans, objectives and \nexpected performance. There can be no assurance that actual results will not \ndiffer materially due to various factors, many of which are beyond the \ncontrol of Columbia, including, but not limited to, the regulatory approval \nprocess, competition, weather, supply and demand for natural gas, and changes \nin general economic conditions. \n\n/CONTACT:  Media: Michael J.

What I am not sure of is what if any decision \nhas to be\nmade on May 19.  It seems to me that the Mystic Lady and Elba Island deals \nhave already\nbeen approved and executed - but it is quite likely I am missing a detail or \ntwo.\n\nJohn\n\n\n\nVince J Kaminski\n15/05/2000 17:14\nTo: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Gorte/HOU/ECT@ECT, Rick \nBuy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: Re: LNG May 19 decision  \n\nJohn,\n\nThis is the update on what I have done for the LNG transactions.\n\n1. I was not involved in the LNG ship project. I shall  read the DASH \nand give you my comments. Without looking at the details, I think that the \ndecision\nto charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the Elba Island \nproject (please, see point 2).\n\n2. Elba Island. I am working with Doug Rotenberbg, Brad Hitch, Scott Earnest \n(Sally Beck's organization) and RAC to set up the book for the Elba Island \ntransaction. The next step\nwill be to expand the book to capture all the Enron's LNG-related  positions  \nin one place and\nto look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges. A working group is \nmeeting to close a few\nremaining gaps  tomorrow (Tuesday) at 8:30.\n\nA few comments on the book design and my view of the project:\n\na. The current thinking is that LNG will be sourced for the Elba Island \nfacility\nby buying marginal cargos on the fob basis. Marginal cargos will represent\nsupply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long-term\ncontracts or became available due to some short-term frictions.\n\nThe fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the \nlong-term\ncontract prices. The economics of the deal, as represented by the book we are \nsetting up, will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal \ncargos\nbut that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis, arranging shipping and \ncoordinating\nthe facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the US. In other words,\nwe have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction.\n\nb. The transaction will cover the period of 17 years (with an extension \noption of\n5 years). Even if we can lock-in the LNG volumes over this time period, we\nhave no ability to lock-in the other side of the spread (US gas prices) for \nsuch a long tenor. This is  \nessentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the LNG - nat gas spread \nand\nI would not recommend locking-in only one leg of the spread.\n\nOne solution would be to  cover, let's say, 50% of he LNG volumes for the \nfirst\n5 years and lock-in the nat gas side on the US market side.\n\nc. The book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions\nregarding sources of LNG, shipping rates, schedules, etc. I would set up a \nbig prudence reserve\nin case we mark it to market.\n\nd. My group will work on valuation of some options we have in the Elba Island \ndeal\n(that are good for Enron) and on the hedging strategy for the LNG positions.\nLong-term LNG contracts are typically based on the Japanese Crude Cocktail \nthat \ncorrelates very well with Brent.\n\n\nVince\n\n\n\nJohn Sherriff\n05/14/2000 01:40 AM\nTo: Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Lauren Urquhart/LON/ECT@ECT \nSubject: LNG May 19 decision\n\n\nVince\n\nI haven't spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well.  \nAnyway with Greg moving to his\nnew role I have (I hope only temporarily) staff trading oversight for the \nEastern Hemishere plus LNG.\n\nI understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for \nLNG and LNG ship values.   I also understand\nthat another LNG ship decision is on the dockets for May 19 (not very far \naway).  Anway I understand this\nis a big decision but I still have gotten very little info yet.  Can you \nplease let me know where you stand now?\n\nI will ask my assistant Lauren to set up a time that I can speak with you in \nthe next couple of days and if you\nhave anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well.\n\nLook forward to connecting with you Vince.\n\nJohn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

          "body": "CATALYTICA, KAWASAKI, AND ENRON ANNOUNCE GAS TURBINES WITH XONON(tm) FOR\nDISTRIBUTED POWER PROJECT\n\n        Mountain View, CA (May 17, 2000) - Catalytica Combustion Systems,\nInc., a subsidiary of Catalytica, Inc. (NASDAQ - CTAL), Kawasaki Motors\nCorp., U.S.A., an affiliate of Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd., and Enron\nEnergy Services, Inc., a subsidiary of Enron Corp. (NYSE - ENE), announced\ntoday their intent to furnish three Kawasaki M1A-13X gas turbines for a\ndistributed generation power project to be installed in the Northeastern\nUnited States. The engines will be equipped with Catalytica's Xonon Cool\nCombustion technology-the only system that enables gas turbines to achieve\nultra-low emissions without the use of burdensome exhaust gas cleanup\nsystems.  The project is expected to enter service in late 2001.\nKawasaki's commercial introduction of Xonon-equipped engines marks a\nmilestone in Kawasaki's program to expand the presence of its family of\nsmall gas turbines in the North American market.  Mr. Hiro Matsumura,\ngeneral manager of the Kawasaki Motors Corp., U.S.A. Gas Turbine Division\nstated, \"We are pleased and excited that Enron has chosen us as a partner\nfor this distributed generation project.  We believe that the combination of\nthis proven, reliable and cost-effective engine with the unparalleled\nadvantage of Xonon's ultra-low NOx performance will permit users to take\nadvantage of the economies of on-site generation with virtually no\nenvironmental impact.\"\nCatalytica Combustion Systems' President and CEO, Dennis Orwig, said,\n\"Xonon's ultra-low emissions will facilitate the siting of new power\ngeneration units in urban and suburban areas. This should reduce both the\nneed for new power transmission lines and the environmental impact of our\npower supplies.\"  He continued, \"We are proud to be working with these two\nleading organizations to bring the benefits of clean, reliable energy to the\nhigh growth distributed generation market.\"\nTom White, vice chairman of Enron Energy Services, commented, \"Xonon is a\nkey element of Enron Energy Services' distributed generation solution to\nsupplying clean energy to meet the increasing energy demands of the growing\nUS economy.  Further, Kawasaki's products can effectively meet the\nchallenging requirements of this emerging market and we expect that\nadditional opportunities to use the M1A-13X will be forthcoming.\"\nCatalytica's Xonon Cool Combustion technology is a patented pollution\nprevention system that avoids the formation of nitrogen oxide (NOx), a\nprimary contributor to smog, by reducing localized combustion temperatures\nwhile achieving equivalent combustion efficiency and performance.  Xonon has\ndemonstrated NOx emissions of well under 2.5 parts per million (ppm) and it\nalso dramatically reduces emissions of carbon monoxide and unburned\nhydrocarbons. Xonon is the only combustion system demonstrated to meet\nCalifornia Air Resources Board and South Coast Air Quality Management\nDistrict emissions guidelines for new gas turbines without the use of an\nexhaust cleanup system.\nKawasaki Motors Corp., U.S.A. Gas Turbine Division (www.kawasaki.com.),\nlocated in Grand Rapids, Michigan, provides a full line of gas turbine\npackaging, parts, overhaul and field maintenance support, and customer\nservice. Its affiliate corporation, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.,\nrecognized as one of the world leaders in the gas turbine industry,\nestablished this division in early 1999 to provide better customer service\nto its North American clients.\nEnron Energy Services is a subsidiary of Enron Corp., one of the world's\nleading electricity, natural gas and communications companies.  Enron owns\napproximately $33 billion in energy and communications assets, produces\nelectricity and natural gas, develops, constructs and operates energy\nfacilities worldwide, delivers physical commodities and financial and risk\nmanagement services to customers around the world and is developing a\nnationwide internet-based communications network.  Enron's internet address\nis www.enron.com, and the stock is traded under the ticker symbol, \"ENE.\"\nCatalytica, Inc. (www.catalytica-inc.com) finds new pathways to improve\nprocesses-reducing time, waste and costs.  It operates through three\nsubsidiaries: Catalytica Combustion Systems, Catalytica Pharmaceuticals, and\nCatalytica Advanced Technologies. Catalytica Combustion Systems' unique\nXonon Cool Combustion technology enables gas turbines to produce essentially\npollution-free power.  Catalytica Pharmaceuticals applies innovative and\npatented catalytic technologies and other chemical processes to improve the\nsteps for manufacturing pharmaceuticals and finds better and more efficient\nways to produce products in commercial scale quantities.  Catalytica\nAdvanced Technologies serves as the incubator for new catalytic technologies\nfor industrial applications.\n\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements regarding\nincorporation of Catalytica's Xonon combustion system into the Kawasaki\nM1A-13X turbine, the supply M1A-13X gas turbines by Kawasaki to Enron, the\nability of Enron to place Xonon-equipped M1A-13X turbines at project sites,\nthe demand for distributed power projects, and the competitive position of\nthe M1A-13X, Xonon, Kawasaki and its affiliates, Enron and its affiliates,\nCatalytica, and Catalytica Combustion Systems.  Actual results could differ\nand such differences could be material.  These statements involve risks and\nuncertainties, including without limitation, the fact that there may be\nunanticipated technical, commercial, or other factors related to the\nincorporation of Xonon into the M1A-13X turbines or the arrangements between\nKawasaki and Enron for the supply of M1A-13X gas turbines, that marketing,\nproject development, and installation timelines and regulatory review\noutcomes are uncertain, and that opportunities may differ from those stated.\nEnron and Catalytica undertake no obligation to update publicly any\nforward-looking statements to reflect new information, events, or\ncircumstances after the date of this release.  Investors are encouraged to\nreview SEC filings for factors that could affect Enron's future performance\nand Catalytica's SEC Form 10-K filing for the year ending December 31, 1999,\nfiled with the Securities and Exchange Commission for additional factors\nthat could affect Catalytica's future performance.\n\n# # # #\n\nEditors' Note:  Xonon and Cool Combustion are trademarks of Catalytica."

While it is true that one of the reasons FERC \nrejected the NNG filing in which we sought authority to hold capacity on \nunspecified pipelines was because it was too general, the Commission never \nstated that pipelines must file specific deals in order to comport with the \nTexas Eastern requirements.  I believe that the filing is specific enough to \naddress the Commission's concerns because we have narrowed it down to a \nspecific portion of a specific pipeline in order to help alleviate a \nconstraint on TW's system. The Commission did not require us to have an \nagreement with PG&E for Market Center services, and in fact we did not have a \ndeal in place when we made our filing.   While I'm sure it's true that having \na specific deal in place would make our filing even more convincing, the \nCommercial Group would like to maximize their flexibility to acquire capacity \non PNM instead of having to ask permission for each deal they do with PNM, \nwhich is why we would prefer to use the same strategy we successfully \nemployed in our Market Center services filing.  \n\nOn the Hinshaw issue -- I will forward you the relevant e-mail chain from \nlast week.\n\n\n   \n\t\n\t\n\tFrom:  Mary Kay Miller                           03/20/2000 07:04 AM\n\t\n\nTo: Glen Hass\ncc: Mary Darveaux, Susan Scott/ET&S/Enron@ENRON \n\nSubject: holding capacity on PNM\n\nI didn't see you on the distribution,  please respond to Susan's question on \ntiming. \nSusan,  if the capacity is 10,000, what is the rate?

          "body": "---------------------- Forwarded by Vince J Kaminski/HOU/ECT on 04/28/2000 \n02:38 PM ---------------------------\n\n\nRobert Brooks <rebrooks@earthlink.net> on 04/28/2000 12:11:11 PM\nPlease respond to \"rebrooks@rbac.com\" <rebrooks@rbac.com>\nTo: \"'GPCM Distribution'\" <rebrooks@rbac.com>\ncc:  \nSubject: Can Supply Grow Fast Enough to Meet Increased Demand?\n\n\nFor GPCM Modelers from http://www.enerfax.com:\n\n\nNatural Gas Supply Chasing  Demand\n\n    Natural gas suppliers face a tough challenge in meeting strong growth in\ndemand in the near future, experts told an industry conference in Houston\nyesterday. The MMS and the National Petroleum Council have projected that\ndemand for natural gas could rise to 30 Tcf a year by 2010 from current\nlevels of 22 Tcf. Finding and delivering enough natural gas to meet such an\nincrease, even if demand takes another ten years to reach such levels, will\nbe not be easy, the conference was told. The Gulf of Mexico currently\nprovides about a quarter of the nation's natural gas requirements and is\nexpected to generate the majority of future production growth. The MMS says\nthat natural gas production from the Gulf of Mexico would likely rise from\nabout 5 Tcf a year now to a peak of 6.1 Tcf in 2005 and then start to\ndecline.  At best, production would peak at 6.7 Tcf in 2010 then bedin to\ndecline. Chevron says that to meet demand of 30 Tcf by 2020, average daily\ngas production in the Gulf of Mexico would have to rise to 22 Bcf cubic feet\nfrom about 14 Bcf now. The GRI says it expects the Gulf of Mexico and Canada\nto be 'key pillars' in meeting US demand for natural gas. The GRI projects\nthat Gulf of Mexico production can reach 8 Tcf a year by 2015, while Canadian\nimports will rise to 4 Tcf a year from 3 Tcf. Over the same period the GRI\nforecasts that supply in the lower 48 states can grow by 5.7 Tcf, with the\nRocky Mountains region contributing a third of the increase. Ziff Energy said\nplanners and forecasters might be taking too pessimistic a view of production\ndecline rates from mature gas wells in the shallow waters of the Gulf of\nMexico. Those wells usually show a rapid decline in production in the early\nyears of their life but then they tend to maintain stable output for\nrelatively long periods. Also, the MMS said new technologies such as\ngas-to-liquid conversion, could help to harness stranded gas in remote\nlocations where pipeline systems cannot be built. Storage will also play an\nincreasingly important role.\n\n\nOffshore Drillers Beginning to Recover\n\n    The offshore oil and natural gas drilling sector has enjoyed a modest\nupturn in fortunes for the first quarter, but their mood remains far from\njubilant as earnings lag well behind the peak levels of 1998. The benefits of\nthe strong recovery in oil prices over the past year have been slow to\ntrickle down to drilling contractors because most large producers have not\nraised their drilling budgets. Over the last week most US drilling companies\nhave reported sharp earnings declines for the first quarter of 2000, compared\nto a year ago. However, many of them posted better numbers than in the final\nquarter of 1999 and even managed to better Wall Street's estimates of\nearnings per share by a few cents. Although earnings are still showing scant\nupward momentum, their stock prices have performed strongly since last year\nin anticipation of a gradual improvement. The Philadelphia Stock Exchange\noilfield services index, rose 66.8% in 1999 and is up another 31% so far this\nyear. So far, the recovery has been largely confined to the shallow waters of\nthe Gulf of Mexico, fueled by a scramble to produce more natural gas.\nDay-rates for Gulf of Mexico jackups have risen 30% compared with the final\nquarter of 1999, with utilization rising to 99% from 87%. Day-rates for\njackups in the North Sea and Asia, however, have fallen with utilization of\ndown to 77% from 81%.\n\nBob Brooks\nGPCM Natural Gas Market Forecasting System\n\n\n"

          "body": "Hi folks:\n Very glad to hear about the new developments. Just to recap what we \ndiscussed this morning about different things you need to look into to set up \ntrading operations and the contacts:\n\n1. Licence to trade: Regulatory people: I guess you know about this part \nbetter than me.\n\n2. Trading & Risk Mgmt: Global Risk Mgmt oversight: John Sherrif in London \nhas the overall responsibility outside Western Hemisphere. Research group can \nhelp with the structuring models used for trading.\n\n3. Risk Conrols: Before trading group is operational, it needs to get the \nauthorization from the Board of Directors of Enron along with total position \nlimits and possibly value@risk limits. These limits are typically by \ncommodity type and by region. Risk Assessment & Control (RAC) under Rick Buy \nperforms the internal control function ensuring that the businesses adhere to \nthese trading limits.  Ted Murphy is the VP in RAC overseeing the trading \noperations. The value@risk models come from the Research group, but \nday-to-day monitoring of the numbers is done by Ted's group. \n\n4. Credit Risk: A credit reserve number is computed for each deal (again, the \nmodels are created by Research) and is transferred to the credit group under \nBill Bradford (also in RAC). This is basically like buying insurance from the \ncorp. , so that if there is a couterparty default, the loss is covered by the \nreserve pool of the credit dept.\n\n5. Legal: The name I was given is Alan Aronowitz for legal help.\n\n6. Back Office: Initially can survive with Excel spreadsheets. You should \ncontact the IT though when the plans finalize to talk about systems. \n\nAustralia is the most recent place where we set up the trading operations. \nYou can talk to Paul Quilky, the trader there to talk about these issues \n(mention to him that Grant Masson in Research gave his name). \n\nBarry Pierce in London was incharge of back office at the begin there.\n I can coordinate for talking with people next week. Give me a call Monday if \npossible. I hadn't the time to search for the presentation stuff today. Will \ndo it next week.\n\nKrishna."

In \naddition, we had them administer certain remaining gas purchase contracts as \nwell as our de minimus sales function.  All Amgas does today is administer \nour sales function.  We never eliminated our sales function; we just \ntransferred the administration of it to Amgas.  \n\nThe marketing affiliate rule requires that a pipeline's sales division be \ntreated as a functional equivalent of a marketing affiliate.   Our standards \nof conduct provide that the Vice President of Finance and Accounting is \nadvised of pertinent sales activities by Amgas but does not participate in \nany of the day-to-day operations of Transwestern's merchant function.  As a \nresult, the VP is not a shared operating employee under Standard G.  FTS-2 \ntransportation service is the unbundled no-notice transportation service the \n(former and current) sales customers received under Order No.  636.   I think \nwe should be able to file revised standards saying that the merchant function \nis even smaller than it was when we unbundled [true?] which is not enough \nwork for an agent to perform and that we've brought it back in house and \nexplain why the person with the sales function responsibility is not a shared \noperating employee under G.

If we \ncan save the $60,000/yr, it would be worth asking FERC for authority to \nsimply use an ET&S market services person to administer the farm tap sales \nfrom time to time, without any functional separation or other junk.  We could \neven list the specific sales contracts we have so FERC would be comfortable \nthat we are not going to expand the business.  The NN situation was different \n(I think) because NN had formally notified FERC that it was discontinuing use \nof its sales rate schedule.  Would TW use the FTS-2 rate schedule?  We have \nnever formally discontinued the TW sales function, right?   What do you guys \nthink about the likelihood that FERC would approve such a waiver?

TW no longer \nhas any gas purchase contracts, just a handful of sales contracts to persons \nwho granted rights of way to TW.  Many of these parties don't even buy gas on \na regular basis, but they still have the contractual right to do so.  We pay \nAmGas around $60,000/year to administer the contracts.  The AmGas contract is \nterminable on 30 days notice.\n\nI know that last year NNG re-established its pipeline sales division to make \noccasional gas sales and for other economic reasons (i.e. the base gas \ndeal).  Do you think it would be worthwhile for TW to do the same?  Looks \nlike NNG had an easy time getting its filing approved, but would like to hear \nfrom you what all was involved behind the scenes -- in other words, was it as \neasy as it looked?  \n\nAnother idea that Maria suggested would be to apply to the Commission to \nwaive the Section 284.286 requirements in this instance since the remaining \nsales contracts are so few and insignificant. \n\nYour comments would be most appreciated!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

I have been asked by Sally to take the lead on \nmeeting this objective.  For the last several weeks, I have been involved in \nan extensive review of the London office controls and procedures for their \ngas and power trading businesses.  We have used the findings of this review \nto start developing an assessment of controls, standards and measurement \nmethodology for the London office.\n\nIn order to work towards our goal of developing global trading standards \nacross Enron, we need to perform the same controls and standards assessment \nfor the Houston gas and power businesses (we will assess global products and \nother commodities traded at a later date).  I will be in Houston Tuesday and \nWednesday of next week to help facilitate this process.\n\nI have scheduled a meeting next Weds., May 17 from 9:00 - 11:30 in EB49C1 so \nthat we may review our controls, define the standards of meeting those \ncontrol requirements and assess the risk associated with those controls not \noperating properly.  Before that meeting, I would like for all of you to \ndevelop for your  respective functional responsibilities the following:\n - a listing of all controls your group is responsible for (i.e. cash \ncollections are timely)\n - a proposed standard that will ensure each control is being met to its \nmaximum effectiveness (i.e. cash is collected within 30 days of deal date \nwith            exceptions noted)\n - a quantitative measure to allow performance monitoring of each standard \n(i.e. % of cash collected within 30 days)\n - a description of current capabilities to calculate, track and report each \nmeasurement (i.e. automated A/R aging report)\n\nI would urge you to be as detailed as possible in listing your control \nfunctions and to solicit feedback from your managers and leads.  A lot of \nwork has already been done to identify this information so I would hope time \nrequirements for this will not be extensive.  I have attached a worksheet to \nbe completed with the information discussed above.  I have also attached a \nhigh level summary of proposed gas and power standards to use a guideline but \nit is certainly not all-inclusive and should be revised as necessary.\n\nAs discussed above, we will review the controls and standards listings for \neach functional group in the Weds. meeting and also assess the risk \nassociated with each control.  I would like to achieve consensus on gas and \npower operating standards for Houston by the end of the meeting.  Let me know \nif you have any questions or comments regarding this process.  I look forward \nto seeing you next week.\n"

This is a very efficient way of representing the storage \nratchets as the integer search process is able to use the extra information \nprovided by the set, rather than just using binary integer variables to \nrepresent the ratchets.\n\nPlanner is a C++ interface for CPLEX.

Just as EOL is not able to handle this trade, the Sitara \nbridge from EOL cannot handle this trade.  Because of this, there should be \nheighten attention by Trade Capture given to the EOL Bridge monitor.

This has not been started.  In the meantime, a deal of this \nnature will have to be entered manually.\n\nHow do I know that a particular deal has multi-period flow?  Once the EOL \nproduct has been set up, Jennifer and/or Dale will let all involved know.  \nThe person(s) responsible for entering the deal will have to understand what \nis meant by the EOL product's delivery period and enter the deal \naccordingly.  \n\nFor example, assume that a deal has been traded for April:\n\n  Four delivery periods (separate lines) should be included in the Sitara \nticket\n  \n  Start: 04/03 Stop: 04/07\n   04/10  04/14\n   04/17  04/21\n   04/24  04/28 \n  \n Each delivery period (line) should have the same pricing\n\n Remember to enter the EOL deal number when creating the Sitara trade.\n\n Also remember that paths created in Unify assume the stop date is open \nended.  Every effort needs to be made to make sure the appropriate end date \nis on the path; otherwise\n the number of reconciling items will increase.\n\nPlease forward this information to anyone else you think might be impacted.\n\nAny concerns, please contact Sheri Thomas or myself.\n\nSRM (x33548) "

However, each of you agreed that a \nstandard cutoff time was acceptable for US gas, power and liquids products.  \n\nThe best option will be to agree to cutoff at 4pm each day (just to get an \nidea of the numbers we were talking about, I looked at yesterday to determine \nhow many deals were traded after 4pm Houston time.  We had three US Gas \ndeals, and two Canadian Gas deals).  After 4pm, the bridges would \nautomatically roll new EOL deals to the next day.  However, for those deals \nthat do not bridge after 4pm, the various risk groups would need to remember \nthat these deals are the following day's business.  I am not sure how the \nprocedures in Risk would need to be modified for the trader's position \nreports, as the official books would not include these late deals.  Can Risk \nrun supplemental reports to ensure that the desks have accurate positions \neach morning?   \n\nI would appreciate any comments that you may have, and regardless, please \nre-confirm that a cutoff of 4pm works for each of your respective groups.\n\nSheri\nx36557\n\nMike - any potential problems with the DPR?\nPeggy - we discussed briefly a few weeks back...any thoughts?  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

However, this may alter \nthe way we articulate the relative liquidity of our positions to banks and \nratings agencies.  De facto, we will be saying that our balance sheet and \nincome statement reflect an ability to liquidate gas and power in North \nAmerica at the mid with no adverse effects.  While this may be true, \ntypically these types of institutions see the result of liquidating much more \nliquid portfolios, i.e., they will not believe that we have perfect \nliquidity.  I believe that we can satisfy both accounting and credit \nconsiderations if we maintain an ability to calculate an \"orderly \nliquidation\" under a negative pricing scenario (basically, multiple horizon \nVAR against a liquidating position).  This is what we showed Moody's last \nmonth.  The main difference is that the resulting number will be a hit to p&l \nas opposed to having reserves against it.  This is a long way of saying that \nI think it would be a good idea to discuss prudency methodology with both RAC \nand Treasury once you have finalized a course of action.\nTed "

For the current gas \nday,\nthe change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's\nvolume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then\nthe change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For\ntomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using\nthe First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is\n3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the\nfirst-of-the-month volumes for those days.)

          "body": "Another substantive change to consider is the allocation of firm capacity at\nWheeler Ridge between the north and south points.  Currently the settlement\nhas 520 for WH-N and 120 for WH-S for a total of 680.  PG&E has proposed a\n\"let the market decide\" approach on the primary/secondary split by setting\neach receipt point at its physical capacity (WH-N @ 520 and WH-S @ 500 with\nthe combination not greater than 680).  This approach provides more\nflexibility to the shipper to move between the two points and maintain the\nquality of the firm service.  I do not see any cost to SoCal or any other\nparty to the settlement by making this change.  I know Rich Hall has\ndiscussed this with several of you already.  Attached is a document he sent\nme outlining proposal.  Calpine supports this change but realizes that all\nparties need to agree.\n\nThanks\n\nCraig\n\n <<Wheeler Ridge capacity .rtf>>\n\n> -----Original Message-----\n> From: Sullivan, Glen J.

Just a brief update to let you all know what is\nhappening.  This week I finished a 3 week teaching course on the Book of\nRomans, with 8 students from one of the schools in Kodai.  I think that is\nthe most exciting thing I have ever done in my life.  I asked the students\none day who lead them to Christ.  Everyone single one of them have been\nsaved through the ministry that I and Jonathan Daniels have been doing in\ntheir school over the last year.  But what was even more exciting than that\nwas the fact that only one of them was from a Christian family.  All of the\nothers were from Hindu families, except one who was from a Muslim family.\nThat young man's name is Anifa.  He came to Christ through one of the\npograms I did last year at his school. In just one year he has grown so\nmuch, and is known campus wide as young man of integrity and devotion to\nChrist.  Already he has lead several other young men to the Lord.  Anifa\nwill honestly spend hours at a time waiting on God, and the whole school\nknows that he is a man of prayer.  Recently Anifa asked me if I would teach\nhim how to preach, because he said he believes that God wants him to go back\nand reach his people for Jesus.\nUntil Anifa shared his testimony with me, I was getting a little frustrated,\nbecause I thought that in all of my time here in India, I had not won a\nsingle Muslim to Christ.  Now I can leave Kodaikanal confidently, because I\nhave won one young man to Christ, and I know that he will win many others.\nPlease be praying for a team from North Texas District lead by John Bates,\nand a team from San Antonio First Assembly of God lead by Andy Hostetler.\nThey will be coming in June and July.  We will be starting 2 new Churches,\nand ministering in the schools.\nAnd please continue to pray for the new Church in Shenoy Nagar that was\nstarted last summer by the team from Southwestern.\nI look forward to seeing you all this year.  Angela and I are praying about\nGod's direction for our future.  Please pray with us that for God's guidance\nas we plan for our future together.  God bless.\n\nChad Germany\n\n________________________________________________________________________\nGet Your Private, Free E-mail from MSN Hotmail at http://www.hotmail.com\n\n"

Bill and I have been working \nwith Sally Beck, Global Energy Ops and she will identify a  resource to help \ninsure all internal controls (specific to  trading activities) are in place \nin India.   As I understand the plan for coal, India will function mostly as \nan origination unit  with the London office being responsible for supplying \nthe coal.  Therefore, the net Enron position will probably be carried in the \nLondon books.   However, risk books will still be required in India to \ndetermine the net  MTM  for the 3rd party sales commitments in India.  These \nbooks should include both the intercompany purchase from London  and the 3rd \nparty sales.  The commercial group in India  will be responsible for local \ncurves  (location (basis) specific - usually transportation costs), and \nenergy operations (this will probably be you  initially until the trading \nactivity has grown) will be responsible for the deal capture process \n(including contract administration), a settlement process and risk management \nadministration (daily valuation and reporting of risk books).   Accounting \nwill be responsible for the reconciliation of risk books to the general \nledger and financials.    There will also be a logistics process.   The \nfollowing questions need to be addressed:  \n\n  With the increased  coal volumes will an increase in trading limits be \nrequired?\n      My understanding that the London coal group will be responsible for \ndetermining this and working with Ted Murphy to change the \n      policy, if necessary.   \n  What trading activities will be performed in India vs. London?\n      The answer to this is needed to determine the control infrastructure \nrequired for the India office.    \n\nSally's employee starts on Monday,   I will let you know who she is and \narrange a call.    You can rest assured, that although this may seen \ncomplicated (and it is), Sally's Energy Ops team will be able to hold your \nhand all the way through this process.    It will be critical that we \ndemonstrate the control infrastructure is in place, before we can obtain \nsigh-off for trading from Rick Buy. \n\nLooking forward to helping you get this ready for a July 1 start date. \n\n\nThanks,\nWanda Curry\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\nTo: Wanda Curry@ECT\ncc: Bill Gathmann/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT \nSubject: Enron Trading\n\nWanda,\n\nIt was nice talking to you on the conference call. Have you had a chance to \nreview my presentation?. Your comments would be extremely helpful to me. When \nwe setup the Risk/Credit/Accnt/MIS/Internal Control function, I want to make \nsure we do it RIGHT the FIRST time, keeping in mind that there is always room \nfor improvement later.\n\nIn addition, I would like to discuss with you certain thought I have on the \naccounting, budgeting,internal controls and internal audit areas in EIPL. Do \nyou plan to travel to India in the near future. Please let me know.\n\nThanks and Regards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

          "subject": "California Western Storage Initiatives",
          "body": "Note:  Let me know if we need to gather more information on these storage \ninitiatives.  I would be happy to research further.\nLorna\n\nCA Gets 2nd Merchant Storage Project, 3rd on the Way\n\n      Setting aside vociferous local opposition from nearby property owners \nand a proposed denial from one of its\n      administrative law judges (ALJ), the California Public Utilities \nCommission Thursday gave the go-ahead to a\n      proposed $80 million underground natural gas storage field near Lodi in \nNorthern California. \n\n      Texas-based Western Hub Properties' $80 million Lodi storage project is \ndesigned to have 12 Bcf of working\n      capacity, with 400 MMcf/d injection and 500 MMcf/d withdrawal capacity. \nIt includes a 35-mile transmission\n      pipeline that connects with Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s backbone \npipeline. It will be the state's second\n      non-utility storage project, following Wild Goose storage which went \ninto service last year. Approval of the Lodi\n      project is effective in mid-June. \n\n      While CPUC Commissioner Richard Bilas said he supports \"letting the \nmarket decide\" whether a project should\n      be built and encourages competition in gas storage, he \"cannot support \nallowing competitors to use regulatory\n      loopholes to take advantage of private property owners. In my view, \nthis case comes precariously close to\n      allowing that to happen.\" \n\n      Although the Lodi project won environmental approval from an ALJ, the \njudge recommended the project not be\n      built because it didn't meet local-need criteria. \n\n      After postponing a decision on the proposed denial of the project, the \nCPUC president and one of the other five\n      commissioners developed an alternative that gives \"conditional\" \ncertification to the project so it can proceed with\n      development and construction. To do so, Western Hub will have to comply \nwith all the designated environmental\n      mitigation measures, obtain adequate insurance and gain other state \npermits, including the State Lands\n      Commission. \n\n      Western Hub officials have maintained that Lodi's unique geographical \nlocation with proximity to key electric\n      generating plants will be the state's only underground storage project \noffering fast deliverability to meet the needs\n      of an increasingly competitive generation market. \n\n      In sympathizing with the local concerns regarding this project, \nCommissioner Bilas said the opposition efforts of\n      Lodi residents \"have not been wasted. They highlight the need for [the \nCPUC] to continually review how its\n      policies mesh with changing market conditions and how these \ninteractions affect people. This will continue to be a\n      delicate balancing act.\" The CPUC unanimous decision, Bilas said, \n\"attempts to make that balance.\" \n\n      Five local property owners --- one immediately adjacent to the proposed \nproject --- traveled to San Francisco\n      to urge the regulators to reject Western Hub's applications. They \ncalled the company \"very arrogant\" in the way it\n      treated local landowners and argued that the project would \n\"significantly adversely affect the quality of life\" in\n      their community. \n\n      Meanwhile, Western Hub is eyeing a second potential storage site near \nWheeler Ridge, southwest of\n      Bakersfield. It is hoping to help develop an important regional energy \nhub in the southern end of California's\n      central valley. The project would be similar in size to Lodi. \n\n      A merchant storage field in the Wheeler Ridge area would be in close \nproximity to each of the four major gas\n      pipelines in the state and to the sites for several proposed gas-fired \nmerchant power plants --- one of them,\n      PG&E Corp.'s La Paloma plant, which began construction May 17, will be \nthe state's largest merchant plant\n      (1,048 MW). \n\n      Western Hub anticipates moving through the state approval processes \nquicker and having the project operational\n      in the \"next two to three years,\" according to its California-based \nofficials. \n\n      \"This is a storage project that is very similar to the Lodi Project,\" \nsaid Jim Fossum, Western Hub California\n      project manager. The concept of a project in the vicinity of Wheeler \nRidge is being used in Western's ongoing\n      marketing efforts to line up customers and equity financial support, \nbut there are no specific engineering plans or\n      draft regulatory filings in place. \n\n      Fossum said Western Hub owns some rights to depleted oil/gas properties \nin the area, which has a long history\n      of fossil fuel exploration and development covering much of the 20th \nCentury. \"We're working on the engineering\n      of it,\" he said, adding that he is not \"free to pinpoint precisely \nwhere [the proposed site] is located.\" \n\n      \"We have already told people that we intend to be interconnected with \nPG&E, Southern California Gas Co.,\n      Kern River and Mojave pipelines,\" he said. \"We intend to not only \nprovide service to the power plants in the\n      area, but to the Las Vegas area and to the power plants in Arizona.\" \n\n      Fossum said the expectation is that large customers in Nevada and \nArizona could store gas in California for the\n      peak-load times when they need extra supplies; take more than their \nnormal loads off the Kern River or Mojave\n      interstate pipeline and \"pay\" for the extra supplies out storage that \nwould go to uses in California. \n\n      \"On a hot summer day, a customer in Las Vegas may need more gas but \nthere is no capacity available because\n      everyone else wants it, too,\" Fossum said. \"So the Nevada customer \narranges to take extras from Shell or\n      Chevron [or one of the California-based customers] and supply that gas \nback to them at Wheeler Ridge.\" "

I am principal consultant with the firm=20\nCrossborder\nEnergy. My business address is 2560 Ninth Street, Suite 316, Berkeley,=20\nCalifornia 94710.  My\nexperience and qualifications are described in Attachment RTB-1 to the dire=\nct=20\ntestimony that I\nserved in this proceeding on May 4, 2000.\n\n\nI.   INTRODUCTION\n\n     This rebuttal testimony responds to the direct testimony of the Southe=\nrn=20\nCalifornia\nGeneration Coalition (SCGC) and The Utility Reform Network (TURN) in suppor=\nt=20\nof their \"Post-\nInterim Settlement Agreement\" (PISA), which was submitted to the Commission=\n=20\non April 3,\n2000.  The sponsors of this rebuttal testimony include past, present, and=\n=20\nfuture electric generation\ncustomers of the Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) and San Diego G=\nas=20\nand Electric\n(SDG&E).  The sponsors of this testimony are all signatories to and=20\nsupporters of the\nComprehensive Settlement Agreement that over 20 parties filed on April 17,=\n=20\n2000.  For the\nreasons set forth below, the sponsors of this testimony do not support the=\n=20\nSCGC / TURN PISA\nto the extent that it fails to unbundle intrastate transmission, a step tha=\nt=20\nis one of \"the most\npromising options\" that the Commission has identified for the restructuring=\n=20\nof the SoCalGas\nsystem.  I recommend, instead, that the Commission adopt the Comprehensive=\n=20\nSettlement\nAgreement, which moves forward on all of the Commission's \"most promising=\n=20\noptions,\" including\nunbundling intrastate transmission.  The Comprehensive Settlement Agreement=\n=20\nenjoys broad\nsupport from the full range of stakeholder interests in the southern=20\nCalifornia gas market.\n\n\nII.  SCGC / TURN EXAGGERATE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PG&E\n     AND SOCALGAS SYSTEMS.\n\n     In D. 99-07-015, at page 14, the Commission identified the creation of=\n a=20\nsystem of firm,\ntradeable intrastate transmission rights as one of its \"most promising=20\noptions\" for the further\nrestructuring of the SoCalGas system.  A significant element in that=20\ndetermination was the\nCommission's desire to follow the model of the PG&E Gas Accord, and thus to=\n=20\nencourage\nstatewide consistency in its gas restructuring program.  The SCGC / TURN PI=\nSA=20\nnow asks the\nCommission to re-consider that finding, and to defer any further unbundling=\n=20\nof intrastate\ntransmission service on the SoCalGas system.  In support of that aspect of=\n=20\nthe PISA, the\nwitnesses for SCGC / TURN testify (1) that the unbundled transmission syste=\nm=20\nadopted for\nPG&E under the Gas Accord responded to a unique set of problems that have n=\not=20\nbeen present in\nsouthern California, (2) that there are significant structural and=20\noperational differences between\nthe PG&E and SoCalGas systems, and (3) that the Gas Accord structure has no=\nt=20\nbenefitted end-\nuse customers in northern California.  None of these assertions are correct=\n.\n\n     A.   The Commission Should Focus on a Statewide, Consistent Structure=\n=20\nfor the\n          Gas Utilities Moving Forward, Not on Whether PG&E and SoCalGas Ha=\nve\n          Had Similar Problems in the Past.\n\n     SCGC / TURN witness Mr. Florio describes at length the problems that l=\ned=20\nto the\nadoption on transmission unbundling for PG&E in the Gas Accord settlement. =\n=20\nHe views PG&E's\ndifficulties as far more extensive than those that SoCalGas now faces, thus=\n=20\njustifying more\n\"extreme measures\" such as the unbundling of intrastate transmission.  SCGC=\n /=20\nTURN Testimony,\nat Section 2.1.1.2.\n\n     In my view, both PG&E and SoCalGas have faced the same types of=20\nproblems, even if the\neconomic distortions on the PG&E system have been greater.  On both systems=\n,=20\nshippers have not\nhad a system of firm capacity rights, allocated by non-discriminatory, open=\n=20\naccess procedures, to\ngovern who had access to what receipt point.  On the PG&E system, the attem=\npt=20\nto discriminate\nagainst PGT Expansion volumes that sought to use PG&E's Line 400 resulted i=\nn=20\nthe \"crossover\"\nproblems at Malin.  Similarly, SoCalGas' \"windowing\" procedures have not=20\nprovided firm, non-\ndiscriminatory access at SoCalGas' receipt points.  \"Windowing\" has=20\nrestricted the access of\ncompetitive gas supplies to receipt points such as Wheeler Ridge, just as t=\nhe=20\n\"crossover ban\"\nlimited the competition to sell gas at Malin onto PG&E's Line 400.\n\n     Furthermore, SoCalGas has also faced the same sort of \"conflict of=20\ninterest\" charges as\nPG&E.  SoCalGas' core procurement department has been criticized for=20\nmonopolizing the Hector\nRoad receipt point, to the benefit of SoCalGas' shareholders through the Ga=\ns=20\nCost Incentive\nMechanism.  See D. 99-07-015, at pages 15 - 18.\n\n     However, the Commission should not decide the future structure for=20\nCalifornia's gas\nindustry on the basis of whether SoCalGas' past problems have resembled=20\nPG&E's past\ndifficulties. For electric generators, what is important is that the=20\nstructures that the Commission\nadopts in both parts of the state should solve these problems and should be=\n=20\nconsistent on a\nstatewide basis.  The new electric market is a statewide market.  There are=\n=20\nalready at least two\nmerchant electric generators (Dynegy and Duke) and a number of QF projects=\n=20\nunder common\nownership that operate in more than one gas utility service territory. =20\nAnother merchant plant\ndeveloper (Calpine) has made no secret of its intent to operate plants=20\nstatewide.  This trend\npromises to increase competition in the electric market.  To encourage this=\n=20\ntrend, the Commission\nshould focus on carrying through on D. 99-07-015's promise to increase the=\n=20\nstatewide consistency\nof California's natural gas restructuring program.  The unbundling of=20\nintrastate transmission was a\nkey element of the PG&E Gas Accord, and should be a foundation of the furth=\ner=20\nrestructuring of\nthe SoCalGas system, as well.\n\n     B.   SoCalGas' Backbone System Serves the Same Function as PG&E's, and=\n=20\nCan\n          Be Unbundled in a Manner Similar to the PG&E Gas Accord.\n\n     Mr. Florio claims that the \"network\" nature of the SoCalGas system=20\nargues against\nfollowing the Gas Accord model for unbundling backbone transmission service=\n=20\nfor SoCalGas.\nYet Mr. Florio concedes that SoCalGas' mainline facilities that extend from=\n=20\nthe Los Angeles basin\nto the interstate pipelines on the California / Arizona border do resemble=\n=20\ninterstate pipelines.\nSCGC / TURN, at Section 2.1.1.3. SoCalGas' lines running north from the L.A=\n.=20\nBasin to the\nWheeler Ridge interconnects also are clearly backbone facilities similar to=\n=20\nPG&E's.  With respect\nto local transmission, SoCalGas' network of local transmission lines inside=\n=20\nthe L.A. Basin is\nsimilar to PG&E's network of local transmission lines in its load centers i=\nn=20\nthe Bay Area and\nCentral Valley.  Indeed, both the PG&E and SoCalGas systems can be consider=\ned=20\nto be \"spokes\"\nof backbone lines transporting gas from the interstate pipeline receipt=20\npoints to \"hubs\" of\nnetworked local transmission facilities.  The two systems differ in the=20\nlength and number of the\n\"spokes\" (SoCalGas' are shorter and more numerous), but operationally these=\n=20\ncomponents serve\nthe same function.  In my view, there is just as strong an operational basi=\ns=20\nfor unbundling\nSoCalGas' backbone and local transmission facilities and services as there=\n=20\nwas for unbundling\nPG&E's.\n\n     C.   The Benefits of the Gas Accord's City-Gate Market Have Been=20\nSubstantial\n          for Electric Generators.\n\n     Mr. Weil downplays the benefits that the Gas Accord has produced throu=\ngh=20\ncompetition\namong suppliers in the PG&E city-gate market that the Gas Accord created. =\n=20\nFirst, he appears to\ncite the existing data as showing \"average benefits of around 2 cents or mo=\nre=20\nper MMcf/d.\"\nSCGC / TURN, at Section 2.2.2. As cited in my direct testimony, the actual=\n=20\nbenefits have been\nmore than 2 cents per mmcf/d   $0.03 to $0.08 per Dth.  Mr. Weil opines tha=\nt=20\nsuch savings are\nnot significant for core customers.  Ibid., at Section 2.2.2. Regardless of=\n=20\nwhether one agrees with\nhim, such competitive reductions in transportation costs are very important=\n=20\nfor electric\ngenerators, whose total transportation rate is likely to be roughly $0.35 p=\ner=20\nDth, and who, as Ms.\nYap states, \"sell into a highly competitive PX market.\"  SCGC / TURN, at=20\nSection 2.4.1. For an\nelectric generator, a 10 to 20% reduction in gas transportation charges is=\n=20\nwell worth pursuing, as\nshown by SCGC's active participation on SoCalGas BCAP issues that would low=\ner=20\nSoCalGas'\nEG rates by far smaller amounts.\n\n     D.   Customers Have Not Had to Hold Capacity or Pay Demand Charges to\n          Realize These Benefits.\n\n     Mr. Weil also asserts that the fact that relatively few end use=20\ncustomers hold backbone\ntransmission capacity on the PG&E system shows that unbundling under the Ga=\ns=20\nAccord has not\nbenefitted customers.  He opines that this is due to the high transaction=\n=20\ncosts associated with\nholding capacity.  SCGC / TURN, at Section 2.2.3. Ms. Yap also describes at=\n=20\nlength how the\ntransaction costs associated with managing transmission capacity tends to=\n=20\nforce end users to buy\nfrom marketers.  Ibid., Section 2.3.1. She concludes that unbundling has be=\nen=20\n\"great for\nmarketers\" but \"not good for customers.\"  Ibid., at Section 2.3.1.\n\n     This testimony ignores the fact that marketers do not exist independen=\nt=20\nof their customers.\nIf a marketer's services do not add value for the customer, then that=20\nmarketer will not remain in\nbusiness for long. Under the Gas Accord, most noncore end users in northern=\n=20\nCalifornia have\nbeen buying gas from marketers in the PG&E city-gate market.  However, the=\n=20\navailable data on\nPG&E city-gate gas prices   discussed above   show that end users have=20\nrealized significant\nsavings from these purchases, compared to the option of buying gas at the=\n=20\nCalifornia border and\nmanaging their own transportation to the city-gate.  These city-gate=20\npurchases have not involved\npaying demand charges or incurring transaction costs associated with managi=\nng=20\ncapacity.\nCompetition among marketers has assured that customers benefit from=20\nmarketers' efficiencies in\nmanaging transportation costs.\n\n\n\nIII. SCGC'S AND TURN'S COST / BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF TRANSMISSION\n     UNBUNDLING IGNORES THE BENEFITS AND OVERSTATES THE COSTS.\n\n     SCGC and TURN attempt to present a cost / benefit analysis of=20\ntransmission unbundling,\nlargely through the testimony of Ms. Yap, in an effort to show that the cos=\nts=20\noutweigh the\nbenefits.  Ms. Yap ignores several significant benefits from unbundling,=20\ngreatly exaggerates the\npossible costs, and presents unsubstantiated assertions about the impacts o=\nf=20\nunbundling on\ngenerators in the Los Angeles basin.\n\n     A.   SCGC / TURN Fail to Recognize the Benefits of Transmission=20\nUnbundling.\n\n          1.   Unbundling will provide competitive benefits in the city-gat=\ne=20\nmarket.\n\n     The experience with transmission unbundling under the PG&E Gas Accord =\nhas\ndemonstrated that end use customers realize competitive benefits from the=\n=20\ncreation of a city-gate\nmarket.  The city-gate market moves gas-to-gas competition between supplier=\ns=20\ncloser to the\ncustomer, and allows the customer to avoid risks associated with paying=20\ndemand charges or\nmanaging backbone transportation. Those customers who believe they can=20\nachieve greater profits\nby managing their own transportation have that option, and since not all=20\ntransportation rights on\nthe PG&E system are held by marketers, it is obvious that such customers do=\n=20\nexist.\n\n     Mr. Weil doubts that the city-gate benefits seen on the PG&E system wi=\nll=20\nmaterialize, due\nto \"Southwest supply dominance\" at SoCalGas receipt points.  SCGC / TURN, a=\nt=20\nSection 2.2.2. Presumably this refers to the fact that gas prices tend to=\n=20\ntrade within a narrow range of a few\ncents per Dth at all of the receipt points into the SoCalGas system.  Ibid.=\n,=20\nat Section 2.3.1. The\nprice differentials at the SoCalGas receipt points are much lower than the=\n=20\nsignificant price\ndifferentials that have existed between Topock, Arizona, and Malin, Oregon,=\n=20\nthe two major\nreceipt points into the PG&E system.  However, recently the Malin / Topock=\n=20\nprice difference has\nbeen due almost entirely to the $0.10 to $0.12 per Dth transportation rate=\n=20\ndifferential between\nPG&E's Redwood and Baja paths.  Over the most recent year for which data is=\n=20\navailable, Malin\nprices have been essentially equivalent to Topock prices, when adjusted for=\n=20\nthe downstream\ntransportation rate differences.  This integration of the Malin and Topock=\n=20\nmarkets has been the\nresult of rising Canadian prices relative to U.S. markets, which has produc=\ned=20\na competitive\nequilibrium between Canadian and domestic supplies serving northern=20\nCalifornia.  Yet over this\nyear the benefits of PG&E city-gate purchases has actually increased, even=\n=20\nthough there was very\nlittle difference between Malin and Topock prices delivered to the end user=\n. =20\nFrom May 1999\nthrough April 2000, PG&E city-gate prices have been $0.05 per Dth to $0.11=\n=20\nper Dth lower than\nthe comparable cost of border purchases plus PG&E's full backbone=20\ntransportation rates.  This\ndata is summarized in my Table 1.  Contrary to the SCGC / TURN testimony,=\n=20\nthis recent\nexperience suggests that the price benefits from competition at a new=20\nSoCalGas city-gate may be\njust as large as those actually observed on the PG&E system.\n\nTable 1\n\nNatural Gas Market (May-99 through Apr-00)   $/MMBtu\n\nGas Prices\n                             Malin\n                             Topock\n                         PG&E City-gate\n\n\nCalifornia Border:\n                              2.44\n                              2.56\n\n\n\nCity-gate Market:\n\n\n                              2.71\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPG&E Transportation:\n                            Redwood\n                              Baja\n\n\n\n                                                          Firm:\n                                                           0.32\n                                                           0.22\n\n\n\n                                                  As-Available:\n                                                           0.38\n                                                           0.26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice of Border\nPurchases at City-gate\n\n\n\n\n\nFirm:\n2.76\n2.78\n\n\n\nAs-Available:\n2.82\n2.82\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefits of City-gate overBorder Purchases\n\n\n\n\n\nFirm:\n0.05\n0.07\n\n\n\nAs-Available:\n0.11\n0.11\n\n\nData Source: Natural Gas Intelligence\n              2.    The Comprehensive Settlement reduces rates for EG=20\ncustomers.\n\n          Transmission unbundling, as proposed in the Comprehensive=20\nSettlement, will result in a\nmodest reduction in transportation rates for electric generators.  My direc=\nt=20\ntestimony discussed\nhow transmission unbundling under the Comprehensive Settlement will reduce =\nEG=20\nrates by $3\nmillion per year in 2002, or about $0.01 per Dth, compared to the SoCalGas=\n=20\nrates adopted in the\nrecent BCAP decision, D. 00-04-060.  In addition, the Comprehensive=20\nSettlement unbundles\ntransmission rates on an embedded cost basis, removing roughly half of the =\nEG=20\nrate from\nSoCalGas' complex, contentious long-run marginal cost rate design.  This wi=\nll=20\nenhance the\ncertainty and stability of SoCalGas' EG rate   a particularly important=20\nfactor to EG customers\nthat may seek to build new gas-fired capacity on the SoCalGas system.\n\n              3.    The Comprehensive Settlement reduces risks for EG=20\ncustomers.\n\n          Ms. Yap comments at length on how \"if a generator's fundamental=\n=20\nrisk increases, investors\ndemand more net income from the operation to compensate them for that=20\nincreased level of risk.\"\nSCGC / TURN, at Section 2.4.3.  In my view, the Comprehensive Settlement=20\nreduces a number\nof important risks for electric generators, compared to the SCGC / TURN PIS=\nA,=20\nas follows:\n\n=0F0         SoCalGas shareholders will assume 100% risk for the recovery o=\nf=20\nunbundled backbone\n          transmission costs.  This protects electric generation customers=\n=20\nfrom bearing higher\n          backbone transmission costs if SoCalGas discounts backbone rates =\nor=20\nif declining\n          throughput leads to reduced backbone transmission revenues.\n\n=0F0         The Comprehensive Settlement prices transmission services on a=\nn=20\nembedded cost basis\n          through August, 2006.  This removes the calculation and allocatio=\nn=20\nof marginal transmission\n          costs as an issue in the next SoCalGas BCAP case.\n\n=0F0         The Comprehensive Settlement uses a defined 79% load factor to=\n=20\nprice backbone\n          transmission service through the term of the settlement.  This=20\nremoves the risk that declining\n          throughput on the SoCalGas system could raise backbone transmissi=\non=20\nrates in the next\n          SoCalGas BCAP case.\n\n=0F0         The Comprehensive Settlement reduces customers' risk for reven=\nues=20\nfrom unbundled\n          storage services to 25% in the second year (beginning in April,=\n=20\n2002), while the SCGC /\n          TURN PISA maintains the 50% risk adopted in D. 00-04-060 through=\n=20\n2002.\n\n=0F0         The Comprehensive Settlement unbundles SoCalGas' transmission,=\n=20\nstorage, and balancing\n          services.  This will offer electric generators a number of new=20\nopportunities to reduce their\n          costs, including (1) city-gate gas purchases, (2) self-balancing =\nor=20\ncompetitive balancing\n          services, and (3) new, competitive storage services.  In my=20\nopinion, these opportunities\n          reduce the risk that generators in the Los Angeles Basin will be=\n=20\ncaught in a \"price squeeze\"\n          between their gas costs and their electric revenues, because they=\n=20\nwill have more ways in\n          which to reduce their gas costs.\n\n          B.  SCGC / TURN Greatly Overstate the Impact of Demand Charges.\n\n          The use of demand charges for backbone transmission service appea=\nrs=20\nto be the focal point\nof SCGC / TURN's opposition to transmission unbundling.  Throughout their=\n=20\ntestimony, SCGC /\nTURN overstate the impact of demand charges:\n\n=0F0         Ms. Yap's Figure 1, showing the impact of a customer's load fa=\nctor=20\non its average\n          transportation rate, assumes that the customer's entire rate is=\n=20\ncollected in a demand charge.\n          SCGC / TURN, at Section 2.4.1. She fails to note that the demand=\n=20\ncharge for firm backbone\n          transmission under the Comprehensive Settlement will be only abou=\nt=20\n22% of the total EG\n          rate under the SFV rate option, and just 12% of the rate under th=\ne=20\nalternative backbone rate\n          with a 50% demand component.\n\n=0F0         Ms. Yap presents the results of \"a study of more than half of =\nthe=20\ngenerators in the Los\n          Angeles basin\" that purports to show that \"SFV-style\" demand=20\ncharges could increase\n          annual fixed costs by \"as much as 20 percent.\"  SCGC / TURN, at=\n=20\nSection 2.4.2. I have\n          examined the workpapers for this study, obtained in by Southern=\n=20\nCalifornia Edison in\n          discovery, and it is based on wholly unrealistic assumptions for=\n=20\nhow generators will buy gas\n          under the Comprehensive Settlement.  First, the study assumes tha=\nt=20\neach generator will\n          contract at the SFV rate proposed in the Comprehensive Settlement=\n=20\nfor a quantity of firm\n          backbone capacity based on the generator's theoretical maximum ga=\ns=20\nuse in a day (that\n          is, its generating capacity in MW, times its average heat rate,=\n=20\ntimes 24 hours).  Apparently,\n          this assumption is made regardless of whether the plant has=20\nactually ever used that much gas\n          in a single day.  The plants studied are mostly intermediate-load=\n=20\nor peaking units, and almost\n          certainly never operate at anything approaching full capacity for=\n=20\nall 24 hours of a day.  As a\n          result of this assumption, the plants studied are assumed to=20\ncontract for 1,426 MDth per day\n          of backbone capacity.  According to the study, these units=20\nrepresent 43% (i.e. less than one-\n          half) of the gas-fired capacity in the Los Angeles Basin.  If all=\n=20\ngenerators in the basin\n          contracted for capacity in this way, electric generators alone=20\nwould demand 3,316 MDth per\n          day of capacity, or 93% of SoCalGas' total receipt point capacity=\n! =20\nThere is obviously no\n          such demand today for firm service to electric generators on the=\n=20\nSoCalGas system.  Second,\n          the study assumes that the generators will make no effort to=20\nbroker, release, or sell the\n          massive amount of excess capacity that they have bought and will=\n=20\nderive no revenues from\n          such off-peak capacity sales.\n\n          Thus, the study's dire picture of the impact of demand charges on=\n=20\nlow-load factor\n     generators assumes that such generators massively over-contract for=20\ncapacity, and fail to\n     take advantage of the numerous means available under the Comprehensive=\n=20\nSettlement to\n     reduce or eliminate their demand charge risks:\n\n          The Comprehensive Settlement offers an optional backbone rate wit=\nh=20\na 50% demand\n          charge that almost halves the demand charge risk, but offers the=\n=20\nsame firm priority as the\n          SFV demand charge.\n\n          Under the comprehensive settlement, interruptible service at=20\nvolumetric rates is always\n          available at no more than a 20% premium over firm backbone rates,=\n=20\nand may even be\n          available at less than the firm backbone rates, particularly duri=\nng=20\nlow-demand periods.\n          With a backbone rate of $0.0719 per Dth, this premium is no more=\n=20\nthan $0.0144 per Dth.\n          Ms. Yap observes (in Section 2.3.1) that the interstate pipelines=\n=20\nsupplying SoCalGas have\n          at least 1,000 MMcf/d (or 30%) more capacity than SoCalGas'=20\nintrastate system.  She\n          does not recognize that SoCalGas' backbone system also has more=\n=20\nthan 900 MMcf/d of\n          excess capacity, plus substantial excess storage capacity.  Due t=\no=20\nthis excess intrastate\n          capacity, it is difficult to imagine a scenario, for the=20\nforeseeable future, in which a low-\n          load factor generator would ever have to pay more than the maximu=\nm=20\ninterruptible rate\n          for \"virtually firm\" backbone service.\n\n          I have re-calculated the results of the SCGC / TURN study, under=\n=20\nthe assumption that\n          generators in the Los Angeles basin take interruptible service, i=\nn=20\norder to avoid demand\n          charges, at the full $0.0144 per Dth premium for interruptible=20\nservice.  In this case, the\n          generators' annual fixed costs increase by just six-tenths of one=\n=20\npercent (0.6%).  In\n          reality, I expect that interruptible or released firm service wil=\nl=20\nbe available for much of the\n          year at all-volumetric rates that are much less than the maximum=\n=20\ninterruptible rate.\n\n          The Comprehensive Settlement will establish an active market for=\n=20\nthe trading of\n          backbone capacity on the SoCalGas system.  This will provide a=20\nmeans for electric\n          generators to rationalize their holdings of intrastate capacity,=\n=20\nand may be a source of firm\n          capacity at volumetric rates.  Again, the SCGC / TURN study of th=\ne=20\nimpact of demand\n          charges assumes that generators do not use this secondary market.\n\n          Ms. Yap fails to recognize that low-load factor generators will b=\ne=20\nable to avoid paying\n          demand charges (and save money on intrastate transportation, as=\n=20\nwell) by buying gas in\n          the city-gate market.  Ms. Yap's primary concern with the city-ga=\nte=20\nmarket appears to\n          be the fear that marketers will be able to charge a significant=\n=20\npremium for city-gate sales\n          during periods of capacity constraints.  SCGC / TURN, at Section=\n=20\n2.3.1. Ms. Yap's\n          testimony fails to explain her assertion that the city-gate marke=\nt=20\ncould become a\n          \"bottleneck\" on the SoCalGas system.  Upstream of the city-gate=\n=20\nmarket, SoCalGas will\n          have over 900 MMcf/d of excess backbone capacity, plus significan=\nt=20\namounts of unused\n          storage capacity.\n\n          Ms. Yap's \"bottlenecks\" and marketer-manipulated high prices have=\n=20\nnot materialized in\n          two years' of experience with the PG&E city-gate market, even=20\nthough PG&E has less\n          excess transmission capacity and far less storage capacity than=\n=20\nSoCalGas.   PG&E city-\n          gate prices did experience one brief spike, due to very high dema=\nnd=20\nduring the cold snap\n          just prior to Christmas in 1998, but on average PG&E city-gate=20\nprices have provided\n          significant benefits to end users, compared to purchases at the=\n=20\nCalifornia border.  In\n          addition, the data that Mr. Weil cites on the parties holding=20\ncapacity on the PG&E system\n          shows that 75 parties hold capacity on the Redwood path alone, an=\nd=20\ndoes not suggest any\n          undue concentration of capacity holdings on the PG&E backbone=20\nsystem.  Ibid., Table 1,\n          Section 2.2.3.\n\n          Furthermore, the Comprehensive Settlement has numerous provisions=\n=20\nto ensure that any\n          one marketer will be unlikely to accumulate a dominant share of=\n=20\ncapacity to the SoCalGas\n          city-gate market.  First, noncore end use customers will have the=\n=20\ninitial two open seasons\n          in which to subscribe to up to 50% of the available backbone=20\ncapacity, without\n          competition from marketers.  This should ensure that end users th=\nat=20\nare interested in\n          holding capacity will be able to acquire the capacity that they=\n=20\ndesire, and is likely to lead\n          to an even greater number of holders of capacity than resulted fr=\nom=20\nthe Gas Accord open\n          season, in which end users and marketers competed together. =20\nSecond, the Comprehensive\n          Settlement limits any one party from holding, at the end of the=\n=20\nopen season process, more\n          than 40% of the intrastate capacity from any individual SoCalGas=\n=20\nreceipt point.  Third, if\n          any party attempts to withhold firm intrastate capacity, in an=20\neffort to drive up prices, that\n          capacity will be available for SoCalGas to sell as interruptible=\n=20\nservice, and SoCalGas will\n          have a strong incentive to market such capacity, because it is 10=\n0%=20\nat risk for the\n          recovery of backbone transmission costs.\n\n     The SCGC / TURN testimony tries to portray low-load factor generators =\nas=20\ncaught in a\n\"price squeeze\" between capped PX prices and increased fixed operating cost=\ns=20\ndue to the\nimposition of demand charges for intrastate transmission.  SCGC / TURN,=20\nSection 2.4.3.  The\ntestimony paints a grim picture of plants closing, and jobs lost, in the Lo=\ns=20\nAngeles Basin.\nHowever, there are a number of elements in this picture that simply do not=\n=20\nadd up:\n\n=0F0    The testimony appears to assume that low-load factor generators pay=\n the=20\nSFV demand\n     charges, and take none of the steps discussed above to mitigate or=20\neliminate the impact of\n     demand charges.\n\n=0F0    The testimony does not recognize that there will be a $3 million do=\nllar=20\nreduction in rates to\n     the EG class as a result of the Comprehensive Settlement.\n\n=0F0    The testimony asserts that the increases in operating costs as a re=\nsult=20\nof demand charges will\n     be serious enough to force plants to close.  Even accepting SCGC /=20\nTURN's inflated figure\n     of a 20% increase in fixed costs, SCGC / TURN provide no financial dat=\na=20\nthat substantiates\n     their assertion that an increase of this magnitude is likely to force =\na=20\nsignificant number of\n     plants to close.\n\n=0F0    SCGC / TURN fail to appreciate the logical way to avoid the \"price=\n=20\nsqueeze\" that they so\n     fear: buy gas in the SoCalGas city-gate market.  City-gate buyers will=\n=20\navoid paying demand\n     charges, so their fixed operating costs will not increase.  In additio=\nn,=20\nthe SoCalGas city-gate\n     market is likely to be the gas market that is most tightly linked to=\n=20\nelectric prices in southern\n     California, because it will be the closest market to the generators'=\n=20\npoint of consumption and\n     because almost 60% of noncore loads on the SoCalGas / SDG&E system are=\n=20\nelectric\n     generators.  As a result, generators buying gas in the SoCalGas=20\ncity-gate market will have\n     the highest assurance that changes in their gas costs will be reflecte=\nd=20\nin changes in electric\n     prices, thus reducing the risk of a \"price squeeze between gas and=20\nelectric prices.  This has\n     certainly been the case in northern California.  Straightforward=20\nstatistical analyses that I have\n     performed show that the PG&E city-gate gas price is more highly=20\ncorrelated to PX electric\n     prices than are gas prices in any other market in the state, presumabl=\ny=20\nbecause electric\n     generators in northern California use that market and because it is th=\ne=20\nclosest market to the\n     generators' burner tips.\n\n=0F0    SCGC / TURN attempt to argue that the closure of low-load factor pl=\nants=20\nin the Los\n     Angeles Basin, due to the imposition of demand charges, will have=20\nserious implications for\n     electric reliability.  SCGC / TURN, at Section 2.4.5. At the same time=\n,=20\nSCGC / TURN argue\n     that generators will not be able to recover demand charges because les=\ns=20\nthan 20% of the\n     capacity in the basin is under Reliability Must-Run (RMR) contracts an=\nd=20\nthat there is\n     \"intense competition\" for available RMR contracts.  Yet the lack of RM=\nR=20\ncontracts in the\n     basin is due to the fact that there is enough capacity in the basin to=\n=20\nprovide more-than-\n     adequate reliability and to assure that few generators can exercise=20\nlocal market power.  If\n     some generators in the Los Angeles Basin go out of business due to=20\ndemand charges, a more\n     likely scenario than blackouts is that PX prices will rise in southern=\n=20\nCalifornia, the ISO will\n     make available more RMR contracts in the basin, and those contracts wi=\nll=20\nprovide a higher\n     level of cost recovery, thus offsetting the impact of the demand charg=\nes.\n\n     This completes my rebuttal testimony."

Benton, CQ Staff \nAt the dawn of the year, it seemed Congress would be content to let the \ncurrent session end without moving legislation to encourage further \nderegulation of the nation's $220 billion <electric> market. But developments \nin the past few weeks suggest that groups interested in seeing deregulation, \nas well as the Clinton administration, are building a consensus that will put \npressure on Congress to move some kind of bill this year.\nOn April 6, a group called the <Electricity> Restructuring Stakeholders -- \nrepresenting consumers, <electric> generating companies, senior citizens and \nothers -- released a set of goals they believe should be included in \nrestructuring legislation. The principles include repeal of the Public \nUtility Holding Company Act of 1935 (<PUHCA>) and changes to a 1978 law (PL \n95-617) that required state utility commissions and <utilities> to reform \ntheir <electric> rates and take other measures to even out daily <electric> \nconsumption. (1978 CQ Almanac, p. 639)\nThe group plans to meet with environmental groups and regulators to identify \nother areas where common ground can be reached, said Joe Nipper, chief \nlobbyist for the American Public Power Association.\nA smaller trade group, composed mainly of investor-owned <utilities>, is \nworking on its own set of principles.\nEnergy Secretary Bill Richardson acknowledged the stakeholder progress in an \nApril 17 speech to the National Energy Marketers Association, and he urged \nCongress to pass an <electric> restructuring bill.\n\"Our interstate <electricity> markets are in need of repair,\" Richardson \nsaid, adding that <transmission> access and generation capacity are \ndecreasing as demand for <electricity> grows. \"If Congress fails to act -- \nand act soon -- on restructuring legislation, it will strangle the \ndevelopment of competitive <electricity> markets.\"\nThe two committee chairmen who will have to spearhead a restructuring plan \nhave stated their intent to pass a bill by the end of the 106th Congress. But \nthey must navigate past obstacles that include the compressed calendar, \nelection-year politics and a general lack of knowledge among their colleagues \non how to rewrite or repeal <PUHCA>.\nOn April 27, Senate Energy Chairman Frank H. Murkowski, R-Alaska, will hold \nthe last of three hearings on eight <electric> deregulation-related measures.\nOn the House side, retiring Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas J. Bliley Jr., \nR-Va., has vowed to work toward enacting a bill (HR 2944) to encourage \nfurther state deregulation of the <electric> utility market. That measure, \nwhich would effectively allow consumers to buy their power from anyone, not \njust the nearest utility, was approved by the House Commerce Subcommittee on \nEnergy and Power on Oct. 27. (CQ Weekly, p. 478; 1999 CQ Weekly, p. 2599)\nThe bill also would give states the authority to handle their transition to a \ncompetitive market but contains no deadline, or \"date certain,\" by which \nstates would have to restructure.\nMoving a Senate Bill\nSome are skeptical that the political and practical hurdles can be overcome \nthis year. For example, while they have made progress on principles, the key \nnegotiators -- representing investor-owned <utilities>; <electric> \ncooperatives; municipal <electric> <utilities>; large <electricity> \nconsumers; labor unions, and environmental groups -- still must reach \nconsensus on details the legislation should address, as well as the \nlegislative language to implement any agreement.\n\"I think the chances of getting a bill enacted this year are low, not from \nthe lack of trying,\" Nipper said.\nThe best chance appears to lie in the Senate, where Murkowski's committee is \nconsidering eight bills. \"I am committed to getting something meaningful out \nof my committee,\" Murkowski said in an April 14 interview. Murkowski \nacknowledged, though, that the congressional schedule and narrow consensus on \neach of the bills pose challenges to his goal -- developing a comprehensive \nderegulation bill, not one that only addresses portions of <electric> \nrestructuring.\nThe path in the House appears more difficult, although one key supporter said \nthere is behind-the-scenes movement.\nBliley has promised to hold a markup of HR 2944 before Memorial Day, and he \nhas named a task force of six members to help move the bill through committee.\nJoe L. Barton, R-Texas, the sponsor of HR 2944, said meetings are taking \nplace among Bliley, Republican House staffers and some interested groups. \n\"There is some action; it's just not visible,\" Barton said late last month. \n\"I think what's happening there is that [stakeholders are] jockeying for \nposition.\"\nBarton said he anticipated that a \"fairly good bill\" could be moved by the \nmiddle of May if stakeholders and members come together.\nOne complication: Democrats, in the midst of the battle to regain control of \nthe House, may not move toward a consensus with Republicans. Staff aides for \nseveral Democratic members have already complained they have not heard from \nthe committee staff in trying to work out differences raised in subcommittee.\nBut others point to a 1992 energy law (PL 102-486) that cleared Congress in \nthe weeks before that year's election. It contained provisions allowing <\nutilities> and independent producers to compete in the wholesale power \nmarket; that law has been credited with the current wave of deregulation in \nsome markets. So far, 25 states and the District of Columbia have either \nrestructured their markets or enacted laws to begin retail competition in \ncoming years. (1992 Almanac, p. 231)\nMark Stultz, a spokesman for the <Electric> <Power> Supply Association, a \ngroup of competitive power suppliers and power marketers, said the 1992 law \nwas enacted after the <electric> industry quickly built up a consensus among \nmembers and educated them on what the bill would do.\n\"The industry was able to access that in a very short time,\" Stultz said. As \nfar as getting a restructuring bill through this year, Stultz said it is \"not \nan impossible, unrealizable goal to assume that we could get consensus,\" \nsince key stakeholders have reached agreement on several issues. They include \nblocking \"market power\" -- the ability of a few companies to stunt \ncompetition by effectively using its assets to manipulate the deregulated \nmarket to its advantage.\nWhile the House bill contains many issues stakeholders agree with, Stultz \nsaid it also contains some fatal flaws. He cited as an example its lack of \nfederal agency jurisdiction over \"bundled\" services in a regulated market, in \nwhich <electric> generation, <transmission> and distribution rates are \ncombined in an <electric> bill, and \"unbundled\" services in a deregulated \nmarket, in which the generation rates are broken apart from <transmission> \nand distribution rates and other temporary charges brought on by deregulation \nare included.\nBest Bets in the Senate\nOf the eight bills pending in the Senate, Nipper said the one with the best \nchance of passing is S 2071, sponsored by Slade Gorton, R-Wash., which is \nintended to encourage greater <electric> <reliability>. Nipper said the \nGorton bill would replace the North American <Electric> <Reliability> \nCouncil, a group in which utility participation is voluntary, with the <\nElectric> <Reliability> Organization, a board that would require \nparticipation by <utilities>. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would \nhave jurisdiction over the board, as well as the power to enforce its \npolicies on <utilities>.\nThe reliability issue is likely to intensify in coming months, due to \nproblems <electric> <utilities> faced each of the past two summers. While \nsome plants were undergoing needed maintenance, some <utilities> were caught \nwith their generation capacity down during periods of extremely high demand. \nThe resulting shortage triggered a spike in bulk <electric> prices, driving \nthe price of a megawatt-hour of <electricity> in a few places from $30 to as \nhigh as $7,000. <Utilities> enforced rotating blackouts on customers, asked \nconsumers to reduce <electric> use and passed on surcharges for the higher \ncost of <electricity>.\nHoping to avoid outages this summer, the Department of Energy has scheduled \nfour regional \"summits\" on <electric> <reliability> on April 24 and 28.\nJim Owen, a spokesman for the Edison <Electric> Institute, said a third \nconsecutive summer of service interruptions and significant price increases \ncould motivate Congress to move on the deregulation bill. \"It might push this \nthing up further on the congressional radar screen,\" although a law enacted \nimmediately would not have a quick impact on generation and <transmission> \nreliability, he said.\nOther thorny issues include:\n? How to handle taxation issues between publicly owned <utilities>, <electric\n> cooperatives and municipal <utilities>, and whether <utilities> should \nvoluntarily join, or be forced to join, \"regional <transmission> \norganizations\" designed to allow more efficient transfer of <electricity> \nacross the national grid.\n? Whether the federal government should be involved in regulating the \ninterstate <transmission> of <electric> <power>. Some stakeholders argue \nfederal regulation is necessary to prevent one state or region from \nprotecting its customers at the expense of others.\n? Environmental groups' desire for stronger anti-pollution restrictions on <\nutilities> that produce pollutants while generating <electricity>. And labor \ngroups, wary that deregulation could trigger massive layoffs through \ncorporate mergers and acquisitions, want to make sure their union members are \nprotected.\n\n"

          "body": "Late breaking good news!  Attached find Rich Hall's testimony on behalf of \nPG&E.  It would appear that Mr. Baldwin's extensive lobbying efforts have \npaid off here.  Nowhere do I see a specific reference to Hector \nRoad/Transwestern as another example of the Comprehensive Settlement's \nfailure to deal with the allocation problem at Wheeler Ridge.  That being \nsaid, I note that the \"generic\" prescription sponsored by PG&E applies in all \ncases where, \"the combined capacity of the upstream interconnects exceeds the \ndownstream take-away capacity.\"   Anyone paying close attention, or anyone \nwith an axe to grind here, will be quick to point out that there maybe other \nexamples similar to Wheeler-- can you say, \"Hector Road?\"\n\nWe'll just have to deal with questions on the application of the generic rule \nduring the hearings.  I think it good news that PG&E chose not to spell it \nout for anyone.  Maybe we owe them one after all?

I note that the same\ninterrogatories that TURN withdrew, SCGC is withdrawing.  Therefore, my\noriginal view that we can deal with this without taking up time at the PHC\nstill stands.  I would like you to try to work this out by yourselves based\nupon my indication here as to how I will rule.\n\nThe bottom line is that SoCalGas must respond to those interrogatories\nseeking to clarify which settlement is its first choice.  It is by no means\ncrystal clear, and does impact the breadth of support for each settlement.\n(In fact, I'd like to know SDG&E's view on this too.)  I think this could be\ndone in a limited way as opposed to responses to all the interrogatories\ncomparing the two settlements.  Whether SoCalGas has breached the Interim\nSettlement by also signing the Comprehensive Settlement is not directly\nrelevant to this proceeding.  I don't need to determine that and I don't\nwant to expand this already far-ranging proceeding to include that - take it\nto court if you want to.  Moreover, some of the questions are now moot as\nall prepared testimony has been lodged.  So, please meet and confer again.\nIf you can't come to an agreement based on my views in this email, then\nSoCalGas should file its Opposition on the 23rd, and I'll rule on each\ninterrogatory on the 25th.

The idea in the transaction for which they were tailored was that \nthe California Energy Commission (\"CEC\") and three California UDC's would \ndivert payments they were otherwise  required to make to a blackballed ESP \ninto the infamous \"Lockbox.\"  The bank-administrator of the Lockbox was to \nswear in blood to send money coming into the lockbox to our account first and \ndribble any leftovers to the blackballed ESP as they saw fit.  Also,  the \nmili-second that the funds plunked into the Lockbox a virulent \"Security \nInterest\" attached itself like a vampire to the juggler vein of these funds \nand this security interest was for our benefit.  \n\n Although I am proud to have the  name Yoder associated with the Lockbox \nconcept,  I must in all modesty confess I have never closed out a real deal \nusing the damn thing.  Stewart Rosman, an innovative trader who is well known \nfor his patience with the legal process,  and later,  John \"Big Sky\" \nMalowney,   tried valiantly to get Legal to implement this sturcture but \nalas, I cannot yet put it on my resume as a triumph.

The following is a summary \nof what occured at the meeting.\n\nThe Network\nMCI built the system.\nThe ISO currently shares its private, dedicated network 50-50 with the \nCalifornia Power Exchange, though the ISO like to take control of 100% of the \nasset.\nThe network consists of 4 OC-12s (?) and as part of the contract, the ISO has \na call to upgrade an no or very little cost to 4 OC-48s.\nThis \"scalability\" was built in to accommodate what California believed would \nbe a very large and rapidly growing number of users (mostly scheduling \ncoordinators), but California greatly underestimated the number.  So the ISO \nis left with considerable excess capacity.\nIt's an ATM switched network with 11 A-PoPs and 4 B-Pops and it runs from \nFolsom (Sacramento) to Alhambra (around Pasadena).  The B-PoP locations are \nHayward, Sacramento, Long Beach, and Claremont.\n\nThe Contract\nThe ISO pays about $30-35 million/yr under the contract---significantly above \nmarket.\nThe contract ends at the end of 2003.\nThe contract includes a costless, or very low cost, option to upgrade from \nOC-12 to OC-48.\nThe contract also permits interconnection to the network (by MCI) for $485, \nirrespective of difference from the grid.\n\nThe Goals of the EVP/CIO\n\nReduce costs immediately.   Needs to take a plan designed to mitigate the \ncosts to the Board in 60 days.\nWants to maintain some flexibility in the event usage grows.\n\"Would like to do a short term deal, for \"nonfirm\" service and get  a high \nprice,\" but he would do a long-term, firm deal if it reduced his costs \nsignificantly.\n\n\n"

          "body": "I spoke with John Nimmons regarding the subject settlement discussions on \nTuesday.  He shared with me his view on several matters.\n\n1.  He's not sure what SCE is up to.  He believes they will not move off of \ntheir position of DG ownership however convoluted it may be (basically they \nwant to keep the \"option open\" of customer-side DG ownership).  He also \nbelieves they most likely will not participate in further discussions.  He \nhas a call into SCE to see if he can come to some understanding on where they \nstand.  (He also said they indicated they are most likely going to drop out \nof DPCA).\n\n2.  John believes PG&E was responding to the Commission's position regrading \nDG ownership as outined in the Cmmisson's rule that states the Commission has \nnot found any compelling reason to prevent ownership of DG bu UDC's.  He \nthinks they are not interested in customer-side DG as a business but only as \nan option to site mobile DG under emergency conditions.  He also believes \nthat this issue is not a showstopper for them and they would most likely give \nit up (DG ownership) if others such as DPCA and Enron would support a PBR \nthat gave them the right incentives.\n\n3.  Next Monday's meeting will focus on the distribution only wheeling tariff \nissue (minutes of the last meeting and an agenda for Monday's meeting should \nbe out today).  He thinks this will be the most contentious issue of all \nbased on his reading of the utilities' testimony.  The utilities' postitions \nare that you can't separate distribution from transmission when dealing with \nthe grid since their is much interdepence.  \n\nI think we should continue to participate in these  meetings.  I'm planning \non participating by phone.  I don't expect SCE to participate but if we \nchange PGE's ownership position we would have 2 of the 3 utilities with us \nwhich strengthens our position.  It will also be interesting to see what the \nutilities have to say regarding distribution only tariffs.  ANy thoughts? \n"

Certainly, it  is difficult at this \npoint to project how much backbone capacity will be  subscribed, and at what \ncost.? However, it is a fact that every end user on  the SoCalGas system will \nneed to acquire and pay for backbone capacity in order  to move gas to their \nfacility.? Lad and Gillian made, in my view, a  reasonable estimate that, on \naverage, end users would pay $0.07 per Dth for  backbone service, based on \ntotal backbone costs divided by BCAP  throughput.? Some may use interruptible \nservice and pay 120% of this rate;  others may obtain backbone service at a \ndiscount.? On average, Lad and  Gillian's numbers are a reasonable projection \nand very defensible.?

I'll send a few other things to look \nat.\n---------------------- Forwarded by Susan J Mara/SFO/EES on 05/16/2000 10:28 \nAM ---------------------------\n\n\t\n\tCarl Imparato\n\t\n\t04/24/2000 12:49:26 PM\n\t\nSent by: Carl Imparato\nTo: zalaywan@caiso.com\ncc: smara@enron.com, curt.hatton@gen.pge.com, jim.filippi@gen.pge.com, \ngackerman@wptf.org, alexp@eccointl.com, kewh@dynegy.com, skelly@iepa.com, \njstremel@apx.com, bmspeckman@aol.com \nSubject: CAISO Congestion Model\n\nZiad:\n\nPer our conversation this morning, attached is a summary of what I view to be \nthe key attributes of a \"reformed\" zonal congestion model.  The document does \nnot fully address all of the issues discussed at last Thursday's congestion \nreform meeting in Sacramento, but I believe that (other than for some \ndetails) it is consistent with what both the ISO and many of the market \nparticipants are proposing.\n\nThis summary does not necessarily reflect the views of my clients, who \nhaven't yet had the time to review it... but I don't believe that it would be \ntoo far off.  \n\nI am sending this summary to you to put into context the many comments that I \noffered at last Thursday's meeting and also to support my view that, if the \nISO were to implement the CONG/ASM integration by DECENTRALIZING the process \nrather than CENTRALIZING the process, there would not be much difference \nbetween what I've been advocating in the Southwest and the CAISO's model.  \n(The primary remaining differences would be: (i) the way the \"hour-ahead\" \nprocess works - i.e., continuously vs. one discrete time; and (ii) the way \nscheduling is done - i.e., the ISO would not act as the SC's representative \nin acquiring rights that could be made available through inter-zonal \ncounterflows since the SCs would do this themselves.)  So there is a real \npossibility that, with some agreement on the ISO's longer-term plans (whether \nintegration of transmission rights and ancillary services procurement will \nrely on decentralization vs. centralization), we could bring together the \nmodels for the region.  \n\nCarl\n\n[Sue, Curt, Jim, Gary, Alex, Kent, Steven, John and Barney: I'd appreciate \nany feedback... but if you want me to see it, be sure to send it to \ncfi1@tca-us.com, NOT the enron address from which this e-mail was sent.   \nCarl]\n\n"

The \"Reform Coalition\" (RC) is Hogan, sponsored by Sempra, \nwith ORA/TURN/UCAN (they are all nuts), Reliant, Southern and WIlliams.  \nWithout the gens, they were going nowhere.  Southern has already left the \ncoalition.  We and others have put a full court press on to Reliant (the \nsource of the problem is John Stout in Houston).  The word is that Reliant \nwill also leave -- we're hoping for a big splash saying both Southern and \nReliant have left.\n\nThe other confusing issue is --why Sempra/San Diego G&E?  Terry Winter, ISO \nCEO and former officer at SDG&E, says that Sempra thinks nodalism is the only \nway to get prices high enough in San Diego to encourage construction of more \npower plants.  More power plants, more gas sales.  \n\nThe first item is a matrix from mid-April laying out all the positions at the \ntime.  The RC has now introduced a slightly new proposal called \"voluntary\" \n-- the concept being that you may opt for nodal or zonal on a month-by-month \nbasis.  This had not much support at the meeting at the ISO on May 10 and 11 \n-- especially since you end up with nodalism anyway.\n\nThe next item is a VERY LONG (45 pps) ISO doc -- the ISO proposal is called \nzonal forward -- from late April.\n\nI also included APX's \"flowgate\" model, which has some intriquing \ncharacteristics and which we can support with some slight modifications (it's \nvery close to what we have proposed, and may be easier to use in a world with \nmore parallel flows than we have today)\n\nIf you want more, more, MORE -- go to the ISO web site (caiso.com) then to \nClient Services, then to congestion reform, to see all the gory detail.\n\n    "

While she\nmay offer additional guidance at the PHC on April 24, we need to start the\nprocess of formalizing the testimony supporting the Comprehensive Settlement\nAgreement.\n\nWe have already identified the content and parties responsible for drafting\nthe testimony (as identified below).  The testimony will be based on a \"hub\nand spoke\" approach, where SoCalGas will focus on the mechanics of\nunbundling, describing in detail how the capacity and retail unbundling\nprocess will work, with other parties filing testimony that complements\nSoCalGas' testimony while offering the parties individual perspective on why\nthe settlement is in the public interest and benefits customers, the state\nof California, mom and apple pie - you get the picture.  In addition, I\nwould like to suggest the following deadlines for getting testimony prepared\nand circulated so that all of the signatories to the settlement agreement\nhave an opportunity to review and comment appropriately on the drafts.  I\nsuggest we adhere to the following schedule:\n\nApril 25  Draft Outlines of Testimony  (Optional)\nApril 28  1st Draft Testimony\nMay 2    2nd Draft Testimony\nMay 5    File Testimony w/Commission\n\nI think that it is essential that we circulate the draft testimony twice so\nthat everyone knows what will be filed on the May 5.  The schedule is\ncompressed, but we have to operate within the time parameters we've been\ngiven.   The testimony assignments are identified below.  There has been one\nchange from what we had agreed to previously.  SoCalGas will sponsor a\nwitness on the \"Concepts of Unbundling\".  I would also like to suggest that\nwe file the testimony a one comprehensive document.   I have suggested a\nchapter-style format that might work, but I am open to suggestion.  Let me\nknow what you think.\n\n\nChapter 1    SoCalGas                        Concepts of Unbundling\n\nChapter 2    SoCalGas                        Mechanics of Unbundling -\nCapacity\nChapter 3    SoCalGas                        Mechanics of Unbundling -\nRetail\n\nChapter 4    ORA                                Unbundling Policy and Core\nImpacts\nChapter 5    WGS/WHP/Enron            Transmission, Storage and Balancing\nChapter 6    Edison/Calpine/Dynegy     Pricing and Benefits to Electric\nGenerators\nChapter 7    TXU/Shell                         Core Interstate Capacity\nUnbundling\nChapter 8    Transwestern                    Primary and Secondary Receipt\nPoint Access\nChapter 9    Indicated Producers          Open Season and Impacts on\nCalifornia Production\nChapter 10  Calpine                            Metering Program\n\n\n\n\n"

          "body": "Thanks Mike.? We shall make the additions you noted below.? SoCalGas (Eric \nNelson) will be providing testimony on retail unbundling for the utilities. I \nagree with you that the mass- market retail parties should also include \ncomplementary testimony.? Although we discussed this earlier, I did not \nreceive any firm commitments from the retail folks that they would sponsor \nsuch testimony - it may be an oversight on my part.? Nonetheless, retail \ntestimony by those in the market should include a discussion of the benefits \nfrom Greenmountain.com, Utility.com, CUB, REMAC and the others.? Might I \nsuggest that Enron, as a large mass-marketer itself, coordinate this effort \nwith the other retail partners ? \n\nIn addition, I want all settlement parties to look beyond testimony to the \nhearings, which are scheduled to begin in little more than a month.? We will \nneed to make some time available during late May for practice panels \n(assuming we are granted panel hearings) and individual practice \ncross-examination.? At the same time, we also need to start thinking about \ndirect cross-examination of the SCGC/TURN parties (again, assuming we decide \nto engage in full cross-examination of their settlement).? There is merit to \ncross-examination of the opposing settlement since it is not very well \nthought out, results in substantial cost-shifts, and is not consistent with \nthe Commission's most promising options.? On the other hand, there is merit \nto limiting our cross, especially of Florio, who will use the witness box to \ngrandstand.? It's something to think about.\n\n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: MBD [mailto:MDay@GMSSR.com] \nSent: Tuesday, April 18, 2000 11:56 AM \nTo: 'Cherry, Brian - TPBKC'; 'Leslie, John'; 'Elsesser, Evie'; 'McCrea, \nKeith'; 'Pocta, R.

While she \nmay offer additional guidance at the PHC on April 24, we need to start the \nprocess of formalizing the testimony supporting the Comprehensive Settlement \nAgreement.? \n? \nWe have already identified the content and parties responsible for drafting \nthe testimony (as identified below).? The testimony will be based on a \"hub \nand spoke\" approach, where SoCalGas will focus on the mechanics of \nunbundling, describing in detail how the capacity and retail unbundling \nprocess will work, with other parties filing testimony that complements \nSoCalGas' testimony while offering the parties individual perspective on why \nthe settlement is in the public interest and benefits customers, the state \nof California, mom and apple pie - you get the picture.? In addition, I \nwould like to suggest the following deadlines for getting testimony prepared \nand circulated so that all of the signatories to the settlement agreement \nhave an opportunity to review and comment appropriately on the drafts.? I \nsuggest we adhere to the following schedule: \n? \nApril 25? Draft Outlines of Testimony? (Optional) \nApril 28? 1st Draft Testimony \nMay 2??? 2nd Draft Testimony \nMay 5??? File Testimony w/Commission?????? \n? \nI think that it is essential that we circulate the draft testimony twice so \nthat everyone knows what will be filed on the May 5.? The schedule is \ncompressed, but we have to operate within the time parameters we've been \ngiven.?? The testimony assignments are identified below.? There has been one \nchange from what we had agreed to previously.? SoCalGas will sponsor a \nwitness on the \"Concepts of Unbundling\".? I would also like to suggest that \nwe file the testimony a one comprehensive document.?? I have suggested a \nchapter-style format that might work, but I am open to suggestion.?

          "subject": "FirstEnergy Settlement",
          "body": "By now, most of you have heard about the FirstEnergy Settlement, underwhich \nFE will recover as best we can ascertain at this time, all of its stranded \ncosts.  Key components of the setllement include:\n\n1. FE makes 1120 mw of power available at a price that varies by customer \nclass and increases gradually over the 5 years.  (The price does not include \nline losses which the Company agreed to throw in if another marketer signs on \n- none did),  The market price is also the shopping credit.  The  shopping \nincentive is then added to the credit . The shopping credit for residential \nand commercial customers is low but could possibly work pending analysis from \nstructuring.  The industrial credit is very low.\n\n2. Customers on special contracts (approximately 800 of them), can during the \nfirst year either opt to cancel their contract or extend it through the RTC \nrecovery period, which is unlawful in my view, although that observation did \nnot slow anyone down.\n\n3.  The settlement creates an implicit cap on shopping of 20% since the \nCompany will seek to have the incentive removed once the 20% is reached.  The \nagreement states that if the incentive is not removed, then customers will \npay for the incentive as a deferral which will extend the recovery period.  \nThis too is also unlawful because it allows the recovery of generation \nrelated costs beyond the market development period.\n\n4.  Barring extension of the shopping incentive and other caveats, the RTC \nrolls off on December 31, 2006 for Ohio Edison, June 30th, 2007 for Toledo \nEdison and December 31, 2008 for Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company.\n\n5.  Distribution rates are frozen until 2007.\n\n6. There is a 5% residential rate cut.\n\n7. FE absorbs the pancaking charges for power coming through PJM and MISO \nuntil the RTO is up and running.\n\nThis settlement is basically political.  Over the past several weeks, FE has \ncut a host of sidebar deals with each of the intervenors and customers who \nsigned on to this travesty.  When the parties were assembled for settlement \ntalks, they lasted 2 days before parties surrendered their litigation \npositions.  The hearing schedule is equally aggregious.  Coincidentally, the \nhearing examiners had a schedule in mind that was extremely similar to FE.  \nOur testimony is due on April 24 with no further discovery prior to its \nfiling.  The testimony of FE and defenders of the Stip is due on April 26.  \nWe then have 3 days for depositions with supplemental or rebuttal testimony \nbeing a big IF.  The hearing commences May 2.\n\nThe parties who thought it was fine to give FE $8.9 billion without \nquantification or review are Consumers Counsel, Staff, Industrial Users, \nRetail Merchants, Low income (some), Ohio Manufacturers, Shell Energy, \nKroger, AK Steel, Ohio Hospital Association.\n\nThose fighting the stipulation are all the other marketers, the Cleveland \nGrowth Association, the City of Cleveland, Citizens Action, Citizens Power,  \nSafe Energy Communications Council.\n\nBy separate e-mail, Laurie Knight will send you the shopping credit and \nshopping incentive numbers.  Also, if you would like a copy of the \nsettlement, please let Laurie know.\n\nTwo final points.  We are doing everything we can to try to improve or derail \nacceptance of the settlement, although it appears to be a fait accompli.  \nSecond, the stage has been set for similar type negotiations with the other \nutilities\n\nPlease pass this memo along to anyone else who you think has an interest in \nknowing this information.\n\nThanks,\nJanine   \n"

This is achieved by fitting \na normal distribution that matches the one specified for mean and standard \ndeviation.  The graph below illustrates the method for the numbers discussed \nyesterday.  In this example, the annualised volatility is coming up as \napproximately 23%.\n\n\n\nPRICING & IMPLIED VOLATILITY\nThe pricing is as for a regular Asian option.  The payoff depends on the \naverage of the daily prices for Spanish power for Q2 and Q3.  The valuation \nusing 23% volatility is showing about 15.3 Pta per kWh.\n\nI will schedule a meeting to allow us to take this forward.\n\nRegards,\n\nAnjam\nx35383\n\nSPREADSHEET:"

Ken Malloy, President of CAEM and primary author of the RED Index,\nhas been a public official with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,\nthe Illinois Commerce Commission, and the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nIs there a correlation between states with higher electric prices and\nstates' progress toward restructuring?  There is a stronger movement in\nstates that rank higher in average price, since all contiguous states\nscoring in the top 10 for price also were in the top 20 in the RED Index.\nBut this movement is no confined to high priced states.  Nevada, Montana,\nand Texas all are below average states on price but are ranked in the top 10\non the RED Index.\n\nRED Index 2000 is a 90-page study that measures the progress states have\nmade in moving from the monopoly model of public utility regulation to the\ncompetitive model. A RED Index score of 0 represents the monopoly model and\na score of 100 represents complete and effective implementation of the\ncompetitive model. The index focuses on retail competition and currently\nonly covers electric restructuring, and will be updated twice a year.\n\nCAEM developed the RED Index by identifying 18 key attributes that are the\nfoundation for an effective transition to competition. These attributes were\nweighted and scores were assigned to the different options that states have\nregarding that attribute. CAEM then conducted research to determine the\noption chosen by each state on each of the 18 attributes. The index scores\nwere then calculated based on the methodology and research.\n\nCAEM provides the RED Index at no fee to state public utility commissions,\nstate energy offices, consumer organizations, governmental agencies,\neducational, and nonprofit, public interest organizations. CAEM funds the\nstudy by charging a fee of $495 to private sector companies.\n\nPrivate sector organizations can order a copy from redindex@caem.org,\nthrough the center website at www.caem.org, or by calling 703-250-1580.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me with any questions.\n\nKen Malloy\nPresident\nCenter for the Advancement of Energy Markets\n5765-F Burke Center Parkway (PMB333)\nBurke, VA 22015-2233\no 703-250-1580\nh 703-239-8862\nf  248-928-5040\ne kmalloy@caem.org\n\n[[ KENMAL~1.VCF : 4119 in winmail.dat ]]\n\n - winmail.dat"

We are asking the Commission to eliminate the peak/off-peak cost & \nrevenue study, rather than clarify that the study applies only to excess \nrevenues. (p.2)\n2. References to the TW Global Settlement have been removed. The reference to \nexisting settlements is more generic and included only to preserve our \nrights. (p.4)\n3. A new argument on ROFR has been added.  We are asking the Commission to \nimmediately apply the new policy that ROFR does not apply to discount rate \nagreements. (p.5-6)\n4.Several reporting arguments have been deleted -- masking shipper names, \nclarifying that only senior employee names have to be posted and clarifying \nthe Sept. 1 reporting date.  With respect to these last two arguments, we \nhave decided that we can interpret it our way without further clarification.\n5.New clarification concerning the date for which the lifting of the price \ncaps on capacity release is to be implemented.\n\n\n\n"

On the FERC \nside, protests to the merger application are due on May 3.  We are expecting \nprotests, but until we see the extent of the opposition, its hard to estimate \nthe likelihood of a July order.  However, we all agree that based on the \nfacts of the merger and the types of protests we expect to see, a July order \nis within the realm of possibility.  FERC just issued an order approving the \nPECO/ComEd merger earlier this week.  The order was issued 142 days after the \nmerger application was filed.  If FERC does not find the opposition to the \nPGE/Sierra merger overwhelming, it could issue an order before FERC goes on \nAugust recess (this would also allow FERC to meet its 150 day target for \nacting on merger petitions).  \n\nEven if a FERC order is issued by the end of July, we will still need SEC \napproval.  (The SEC will not issue its order until FERC has approved the \nmerger.)  Joanne Rutkowski thinks that although a September order from the \nSEC is possible, it is not likely, due mainly to the fact that several other \nbig merger proceedings (NSP, AEP, Energy East, ComEd) are in the queue ahead \nof the PGE/Sierra merger awaiting SEC approval.  \n\nWith regard to the Hart-Scott-Rodino filing with DOJ, DOJ approval is \nnormally not a problem, but attorneys with DOJ have expressed some concern \nthat the merged Sierra/PGE company could have potential market power in \ntransmission going into southern California.  DOJ has submitted a request for \ninformation to Sierra and PGE, and we are working on the response to that \nrequest now.  Our attorneys and Sierra's attorneys do not think at this point \nthat obtaining DOJ approval of the merger will be a problem, but until we \nreceive final DOJ sign-off on the merger, DOJ review will continue to be an \nopen issue.  We should have a better idea of whether DOJ is going to raise \nany significant problems with the merger within the next couple of months.\n\nI see that Paul sent you a separate email on the status of the state \nproceedings.\n\nI hope this is helpful.

          "body": "Gas OII Parties\n\nPer our discussion at the April 10 meeting to discuss draft tariffs to\nimplement the PG&E Gas OII settlement, PG&E is providing the following\nmaterials:\n\n* Revised Gas OII and PG&E Tariff Preparation Schedule.  The testimony\nand hearing schedule adopted at the April 11 prehearing conference is now\nincluded, along with revised dates for the tariff approval process for\nPG&E's settlement.  Please remember that much of this schedule is\nspeculative - and highly dependent on the actual timing of Commission\nactions and presumes we can achieve broad consensus on tariff language. For\nPG&E's settlement tariffs, we have delayed our providing a next draft until\nMay 25.  We need the extra time to address the issues raised at the April 10\nmeeting, and to further explore our internal process requirements.  We\ntherefore delayed our next tariff meeting until June 27, which should be\nafter hearings and opening briefs on SoCal matters.  If the litigation\nschedule changes, we may need to revisit our tariff preparation schedule.\n\n* List of Issues.  This list is compiled from the April 10 meeting,\nplus the April 6 CPAG meeting.  As we work through these issues, we may be\ncontacting individual parties to further discuss the issue before we send\nout our next tariff draft.  Please let us know if you have comments or\nadditions to this list.\n\n* Exhibit A to Attachment K to the CTA Request Form, proposed CTA bill\nformat.  A draft of this proposed bill format Exhibit has been completed\nsince we sent out the last package. The attached table is for your\ninformation on the source of various elements to be included in the bill\nformat, and would not be part of the final Exhibit.  If you have questions\nor comments on this Exhibit, please include Cathy Bretz on your E-mail\n(clbe@pge.com) or call her at 415-973-3140.\n\n* Core Rate Impacts of CTA Storage Unbundling.  An illustration of the\nexpected rate impacts of this program was completed since we sent out the\nlast package.  This illustration was presented at the CPAG and Tariff Review\nmeetings. If you have questions or comments on this attachment, please\ninclude Jerry Miller on your E-mail (grm8@pge.com) or call him at\n415-973-4104.\n\nWe also continue to welcome comments or concerns you may have on the draft\ntariffs for our Comprehensive Gas OII Settlement.  We will try to respond to\nthem in our next draft tariff package, to be sent May 25.\n\nThanks to those parties who attended the April 10 meeting and provided\nexcellent comments and suggestions.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nRandy Litteneker\n\n\nAttachments\n\n <<OII + Tariff Schedule w6.doc>>     <<April 10 GasOII Wrkshp Issues_.doc>>\n <<EXHIBIT A of ATTACHMENT K Sample Consolidated Bill Items cb2.doc>>\n<<Illustrative Rates_CTA unbundling.doc>>\n\n - OII + Tariff Schedule w6.doc\n - April 10 GasOII Wrkshp Issues_.doc\n - EXHIBIT A of ATTACHMENT K Sample Consolidated Bill Items cb2.doc\n - Illustrative Rates_CTA unbundling.doc"

Therefore, this is a \nfact specific issue when we do an on-site generator deal, but in most cases \nEWG filings will not be necessary."

For the\nreasons set forth below, the sponsors of this testimony do not support the=\n=20\nSCGC / TURN PISA\nto the extent that it fails to unbundle intrastate transmission, a step tha=\nt=20\nis one of \"the most\npromising options\" that the Commission has identified for the restructuring=\n=20\nof the SoCalGas\nsystem.  I recommend, instead, that the Commission adopt the Comprehensive=\n=20\nSettlement\nAgreement, which moves forward on all of the Commission's \"most promising=\n=20\noptions,\" including\nunbundling intrastate transmission.  The Comprehensive Settlement Agreement=\n=20\nenjoys broad\nsupport from the full range of stakeholder interests in the southern=20\nCalifornia gas market.\n\n\nII.  SCGC / TURN EXAGGERATE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PG&E\n     AND SOCALGAS SYSTEMS.\n\n     In D. 99-07-015, at page 14, the Commission identified the creation of=\n a=20\nsystem of firm,\ntradeable intrastate transmission rights as one of its \"most promising=20\noptions\" for the further\nrestructuring of the SoCalGas system.  A significant element in that=20\ndetermination was the\nCommission's desire to follow the model of the PG&E Gas Accord, and thus to=\n=20\nencourage\nstatewide consistency in its gas restructuring program.  The SCGC / TURN PI=\nSA=20\nnow asks the\nCommission to re-consider that finding, and to defer any further unbundling=\n=20\nof intrastate\ntransmission service on the SoCalGas system.  In support of that aspect of=\n=20\nthe PISA, the\nwitnesses for SCGC / TURN testify (1) that the unbundled transmission syste=\nm=20\nadopted for\nPG&E under the Gas Accord responded to a unique set of problems that have n=\not=20\nbeen present in\nsouthern California, (2) that there are significant structural and=20\noperational differences between\nthe PG&E and SoCalGas systems, and (3) that the Gas Accord structure has no=\nt=20\nbenefitted end-\nuse customers in northern California.  None of these assertions are correct=\n.\n\n     A.   The Commission Should Focus on a Statewide, Consistent Structure=\n=20\nfor the\n          Gas Utilities Moving Forward, Not on Whether PG&E and SoCalGas Ha=\nve\n          Had Similar Problems in the Past.\n\n     SCGC / TURN witness Mr. Florio describes at length the problems that l=\ned=20\nto the\nadoption on transmission unbundling for PG&E in the Gas Accord settlement. =\n=20\nHe views PG&E's\ndifficulties as far more extensive than those that SoCalGas now faces, thus=\n=20\njustifying more\n\"extreme measures\" such as the unbundling of intrastate transmission.  SCGC=\n /=20\nTURN Testimony,\nat Section 2.1.1.2.\n\n     In my view, both PG&E and SoCalGas have faced the same types of=20\nproblems, even if the\neconomic distortions on the PG&E system have been greater.  On both systems=\n,=20\nshippers have not\nhad a system of firm capacity rights, allocated by non-discriminatory, open=\n=20\naccess procedures, to\ngovern who had access to what receipt point.  On the PG&E system, the attem=\npt=20\nto discriminate\nagainst PGT Expansion volumes that sought to use PG&E's Line 400 resulted i=\nn=20\nthe \"crossover\"\nproblems at Malin.  Similarly, SoCalGas' \"windowing\" procedures have not=20\nprovided firm, non-\ndiscriminatory access at SoCalGas' receipt points.  \"Windowing\" has=20\nrestricted the access of\ncompetitive gas supplies to receipt points such as Wheeler Ridge, just as t=\nhe=20\n\"crossover ban\"\nlimited the competition to sell gas at Malin onto PG&E's Line 400.\n\n     Furthermore, SoCalGas has also faced the same sort of \"conflict of=20\ninterest\" charges as\nPG&E.  SoCalGas' core procurement department has been criticized for=20\nmonopolizing the Hector\nRoad receipt point, to the benefit of SoCalGas' shareholders through the Ga=\ns=20\nCost Incentive\nMechanism.  See D. 99-07-015, at pages 15 - 18.\n\n     However, the Commission should not decide the future structure for=20\nCalifornia's gas\nindustry on the basis of whether SoCalGas' past problems have resembled=20\nPG&E's past\ndifficulties. For electric generators, what is important is that the=20\nstructures that the Commission\nadopts in both parts of the state should solve these problems and should be=\n=20\nconsistent on a\nstatewide basis.  The new electric market is a statewide market.  There are=\n=20\nalready at least two\nmerchant electric generators (Dynegy and Duke) and a number of QF projects=\n=20\nunder common\nownership that operate in more than one gas utility service territory. =20\nAnother merchant plant\ndeveloper (Calpine) has made no secret of its intent to operate plants=20\nstatewide.  This trend\npromises to increase competition in the electric market.  To encourage this=\n=20\ntrend, the Commission\nshould focus on carrying through on D. 99-07-015's promise to increase the=\n=20\nstatewide consistency\nof California's natural gas restructuring program.  The unbundling of=20\nintrastate transmission was a\nkey element of the PG&E Gas Accord, and should be a foundation of the furth=\ner=20\nrestructuring of\nthe SoCalGas system, as well.\n\n     B.   SoCalGas' Backbone System Serves the Same Function as PG&E's, and=\n=20\nCan\n          Be Unbundled in a Manner Similar to the PG&E Gas Accord.\n\n     Mr. Florio claims that the \"network\" nature of the SoCalGas system=20\nargues against\nfollowing the Gas Accord model for unbundling backbone transmission service=\n=20\nfor SoCalGas.\nYet Mr. Florio concedes that SoCalGas' mainline facilities that extend from=\n=20\nthe Los Angeles basin\nto the interstate pipelines on the California / Arizona border do resemble=\n=20\ninterstate pipelines.\nSCGC / TURN, at Section 2.1.1.3. SoCalGas' lines running north from the L.A=\n.=20\nBasin to the\nWheeler Ridge interconnects also are clearly backbone facilities similar to=\n=20\nPG&E's.  With respect\nto local transmission, SoCalGas' network of local transmission lines inside=\n=20\nthe L.A. Basin is\nsimilar to PG&E's network of local transmission lines in its load centers i=\nn=20\nthe Bay Area and\nCentral Valley.  Indeed, both the PG&E and SoCalGas systems can be consider=\ned=20\nto be \"spokes\"\nof backbone lines transporting gas from the interstate pipeline receipt=20\npoints to \"hubs\" of\nnetworked local transmission facilities.  The two systems differ in the=20\nlength and number of the\n\"spokes\" (SoCalGas' are shorter and more numerous), but operationally these=\n=20\ncomponents serve\nthe same function.  In my view, there is just as strong an operational basi=\ns=20\nfor unbundling\nSoCalGas' backbone and local transmission facilities and services as there=\n=20\nwas for unbundling\nPG&E's.\n\n     C.   The Benefits of the Gas Accord's City-Gate Market Have Been=20\nSubstantial\n          for Electric Generators.\n\n     Mr. Weil downplays the benefits that the Gas Accord has produced throu=\ngh=20\ncompetition\namong suppliers in the PG&E city-gate market that the Gas Accord created. =\n=20\nFirst, he appears to\ncite the existing data as showing \"average benefits of around 2 cents or mo=\nre=20\nper MMcf/d.\"\nSCGC / TURN, at Section 2.2.2. As cited in my direct testimony, the actual=\n=20\nbenefits have been\nmore than 2 cents per mmcf/d   $0.03 to $0.08 per Dth.  Mr. Weil opines tha=\nt=20\nsuch savings are\nnot significant for core customers.  Ibid., at Section 2.2.2. Regardless of=\n=20\nwhether one agrees with\nhim, such competitive reductions in transportation costs are very important=\n=20\nfor electric\ngenerators, whose total transportation rate is likely to be roughly $0.35 p=\ner=20\nDth, and who, as Ms.\nYap states, \"sell into a highly competitive PX market.\"  SCGC / TURN, at=20\nSection 2.4.1. For an\nelectric generator, a 10 to 20% reduction in gas transportation charges is=\n=20\nwell worth pursuing, as\nshown by SCGC's active participation on SoCalGas BCAP issues that would low=\ner=20\nSoCalGas'\nEG rates by far smaller amounts.\n\n     D.   Customers Have Not Had to Hold Capacity or Pay Demand Charges to\n          Realize These Benefits.\n\n     Mr. Weil also asserts that the fact that relatively few end use=20\ncustomers hold backbone\ntransmission capacity on the PG&E system shows that unbundling under the Ga=\ns=20\nAccord has not\nbenefitted customers.  He opines that this is due to the high transaction=\n=20\ncosts associated with\nholding capacity.  SCGC / TURN, at Section 2.2.3. Ms. Yap also describes at=\n=20\nlength how the\ntransaction costs associated with managing transmission capacity tends to=\n=20\nforce end users to buy\nfrom marketers.  Ibid., Section 2.3.1. She concludes that unbundling has be=\nen=20\n\"great for\nmarketers\" but \"not good for customers.\"  Ibid., at Section 2.3.1.\n\n     This testimony ignores the fact that marketers do not exist independen=\nt=20\nof their customers.\nIf a marketer's services do not add value for the customer, then that=20\nmarketer will not remain in\nbusiness for long. Under the Gas Accord, most noncore end users in northern=\n=20\nCalifornia have\nbeen buying gas from marketers in the PG&E city-gate market.  However, the=\n=20\navailable data on\nPG&E city-gate gas prices   discussed above   show that end users have=20\nrealized significant\nsavings from these purchases, compared to the option of buying gas at the=\n=20\nCalifornia border and\nmanaging their own transportation to the city-gate.  These city-gate=20\npurchases have not involved\npaying demand charges or incurring transaction costs associated with managi=\nng=20\ncapacity.\nCompetition among marketers has assured that customers benefit from=20\nmarketers' efficiencies in\nmanaging transportation costs.\n\n\n\nIII. SCGC'S AND TURN'S COST / BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF TRANSMISSION\n     UNBUNDLING IGNORES THE BENEFITS AND OVERSTATES THE COSTS.\n\n     SCGC and TURN attempt to present a cost / benefit analysis of=20\ntransmission unbundling,\nlargely through the testimony of Ms. Yap, in an effort to show that the cos=\nts=20\noutweigh the\nbenefits.  Ms. Yap ignores several significant benefits from unbundling,=20\ngreatly exaggerates the\npossible costs, and presents unsubstantiated assertions about the impacts o=\nf=20\nunbundling on\ngenerators in the Los Angeles basin.\n\n     A.   SCGC / TURN Fail to Recognize the Benefits of Transmission=20\nUnbundling.\n\n          1.   Unbundling will provide competitive benefits in the city-gat=\ne=20\nmarket.\n\n     The experience with transmission unbundling under the PG&E Gas Accord =\nhas\ndemonstrated that end use customers realize competitive benefits from the=\n=20\ncreation of a city-gate\nmarket.  The city-gate market moves gas-to-gas competition between supplier=\ns=20\ncloser to the\ncustomer, and allows the customer to avoid risks associated with paying=20\ndemand charges or\nmanaging backbone transportation. Those customers who believe they can=20\nachieve greater profits\nby managing their own transportation have that option, and since not all=20\ntransportation rights on\nthe PG&E system are held by marketers, it is obvious that such customers do=\n=20\nexist.\n\n     Mr. Weil doubts that the city-gate benefits seen on the PG&E system wi=\nll=20\nmaterialize, due\nto \"Southwest supply dominance\" at SoCalGas receipt points.  SCGC / TURN, a=\nt=20\nSection 2.2.2. Presumably this refers to the fact that gas prices tend to=\n=20\ntrade within a narrow range of a few\ncents per Dth at all of the receipt points into the SoCalGas system.  Ibid.=\n,=20\nat Section 2.3.1. The\nprice differentials at the SoCalGas receipt points are much lower than the=\n=20\nsignificant price\ndifferentials that have existed between Topock, Arizona, and Malin, Oregon,=\n=20\nthe two major\nreceipt points into the PG&E system.  However, recently the Malin / Topock=\n=20\nprice difference has\nbeen due almost entirely to the $0.10 to $0.12 per Dth transportation rate=\n=20\ndifferential between\nPG&E's Redwood and Baja paths.  Over the most recent year for which data is=\n=20\navailable, Malin\nprices have been essentially equivalent to Topock prices, when adjusted for=\n=20\nthe downstream\ntransportation rate differences.  This integration of the Malin and Topock=\n=20\nmarkets has been the\nresult of rising Canadian prices relative to U.S. markets, which has produc=\ned=20\na competitive\nequilibrium between Canadian and domestic supplies serving northern=20\nCalifornia.  Yet over this\nyear the benefits of PG&E city-gate purchases has actually increased, even=\n=20\nthough there was very\nlittle difference between Malin and Topock prices delivered to the end user=\n. =20\nFrom May 1999\nthrough April 2000, PG&E city-gate prices have been $0.05 per Dth to $0.11=\n=20\nper Dth lower than\nthe comparable cost of border purchases plus PG&E's full backbone=20\ntransportation rates.  This\ndata is summarized in my Table 1.  Contrary to the SCGC / TURN testimony,=\n=20\nthis recent\nexperience suggests that the price benefits from competition at a new=20\nSoCalGas city-gate may be\njust as large as those actually observed on the PG&E system.\n\nTable 1\n\nNatural Gas Market (May-99 through Apr-00)   $/MMBtu\n\nGas Prices\n                             Malin\n                             Topock\n                         PG&E City-gate\n\n\nCalifornia Border:\n                              2.44\n                              2.56\n\n\n\nCity-gate Market:\n\n\n                              2.71\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPG&E Transportation:\n                            Redwood\n                              Baja\n\n\n\n                                                          Firm:\n                                                           0.32\n                                                           0.22\n\n\n\n                                                  As-Available:\n                                                           0.38\n                                                           0.26\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice of Border\nPurchases at City-gate\n\n\n\n\n\nFirm:\n2.76\n2.78\n\n\n\nAs-Available:\n2.82\n2.82\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenefits of City-gate overBorder Purchases\n\n\n\n\n\nFirm:\n0.05\n0.07\n\n\n\nAs-Available:\n0.11\n0.11\n\n\nData Source: Natural Gas Intelligence\n              2.    The Comprehensive Settlement reduces rates for EG=20\ncustomers.\n\n          Transmission unbundling, as proposed in the Comprehensive=20\nSettlement, will result in a\nmodest reduction in transportation rates for electric generators.  My direc=\nt=20\ntestimony discussed\nhow transmission unbundling under the Comprehensive Settlement will reduce =\nEG=20\nrates by $3\nmillion per year in 2002, or about $0.01 per Dth, compared to the SoCalGas=\n=20\nrates adopted in the\nrecent BCAP decision, D. 00-04-060.  In addition, the Comprehensive=20\nSettlement unbundles\ntransmission rates on an embedded cost basis, removing roughly half of the =\nEG=20\nrate from\nSoCalGas' complex, contentious long-run marginal cost rate design.  This wi=\nll=20\nenhance the\ncertainty and stability of SoCalGas' EG rate   a particularly important=20\nfactor to EG customers\nthat may seek to build new gas-fired capacity on the SoCalGas system.\n\n              3.    The Comprehensive Settlement reduces risks for EG=20\ncustomers.\n\n          Ms. Yap comments at length on how \"if a generator's fundamental=\n=20\nrisk increases, investors\ndemand more net income from the operation to compensate them for that=20\nincreased level of risk.\"\nSCGC / TURN, at Section 2.4.3.  In my view, the Comprehensive Settlement=20\nreduces a number\nof important risks for electric generators, compared to the SCGC / TURN PIS=\nA,=20\nas follows:\n\n=0F0         SoCalGas shareholders will assume 100% risk for the recovery o=\nf=20\nunbundled backbone\n          transmission costs.  This protects electric generation customers=\n=20\nfrom bearing higher\n          backbone transmission costs if SoCalGas discounts backbone rates =\nor=20\nif declining\n          throughput leads to reduced backbone transmission revenues.\n\n=0F0         The Comprehensive Settlement prices transmission services on a=\nn=20\nembedded cost basis\n          through August, 2006.  This removes the calculation and allocatio=\nn=20\nof marginal transmission\n          costs as an issue in the next SoCalGas BCAP case.\n\n=0F0         The Comprehensive Settlement uses a defined 79% load factor to=\n=20\nprice backbone\n          transmission service through the term of the settlement.  This=20\nremoves the risk that declining\n          throughput on the SoCalGas system could raise backbone transmissi=\non=20\nrates in the next\n          SoCalGas BCAP case.\n\n=0F0         The Comprehensive Settlement reduces customers' risk for reven=\nues=20\nfrom unbundled\n          storage services to 25% in the second year (beginning in April,=\n=20\n2002), while the SCGC /\n          TURN PISA maintains the 50% risk adopted in D. 00-04-060 through=\n=20\n2002.\n\n=0F0         The Comprehensive Settlement unbundles SoCalGas' transmission,=\n=20\nstorage, and balancing\n          services.  This will offer electric generators a number of new=20\nopportunities to reduce their\n          costs, including (1) city-gate gas purchases, (2) self-balancing =\nor=20\ncompetitive balancing\n          services, and (3) new, competitive storage services.  In my=20\nopinion, these opportunities\n          reduce the risk that generators in the Los Angeles Basin will be=\n=20\ncaught in a \"price squeeze\"\n          between their gas costs and their electric revenues, because they=\n=20\nwill have more ways in\n          which to reduce their gas costs.\n\n          B.  SCGC / TURN Greatly Overstate the Impact of Demand Charges.\n\n          The use of demand charges for backbone transmission service appea=\nrs=20\nto be the focal point\nof SCGC / TURN's opposition to transmission unbundling.  Throughout their=\n=20\ntestimony, SCGC /\nTURN overstate the impact of demand charges:\n\n=0F0         Ms. Yap's Figure 1, showing the impact of a customer's load fa=\nctor=20\non its average\n          transportation rate, assumes that the customer's entire rate is=\n=20\ncollected in a demand charge.\n          SCGC / TURN, at Section 2.4.1. She fails to note that the demand=\n=20\ncharge for firm backbone\n          transmission under the Comprehensive Settlement will be only abou=\nt=20\n22% of the total EG\n          rate under the SFV rate option, and just 12% of the rate under th=\ne=20\nalternative backbone rate\n          with a 50% demand component.\n\n=0F0         Ms. Yap presents the results of \"a study of more than half of =\nthe=20\ngenerators in the Los\n          Angeles basin\" that purports to show that \"SFV-style\" demand=20\ncharges could increase\n          annual fixed costs by \"as much as 20 percent.\"  SCGC / TURN, at=\n=20\nSection 2.4.2. I have\n          examined the workpapers for this study, obtained in by Southern=\n=20\nCalifornia Edison in\n          discovery, and it is based on wholly unrealistic assumptions for=\n=20\nhow generators will buy gas\n          under the Comprehensive Settlement.  First, the study assumes tha=\nt=20\neach generator will\n          contract at the SFV rate proposed in the Comprehensive Settlement=\n=20\nfor a quantity of firm\n          backbone capacity based on the generator's theoretical maximum ga=\ns=20\nuse in a day (that\n          is, its generating capacity in MW, times its average heat rate,=\n=20\ntimes 24 hours).  Apparently,\n          this assumption is made regardless of whether the plant has=20\nactually ever used that much gas\n          in a single day.  The plants studied are mostly intermediate-load=\n=20\nor peaking units, and almost\n          certainly never operate at anything approaching full capacity for=\n=20\nall 24 hours of a day.  As a\n          result of this assumption, the plants studied are assumed to=20\ncontract for 1,426 MDth per day\n          of backbone capacity.  According to the study, these units=20\nrepresent 43% (i.e. less than one-\n          half) of the gas-fired capacity in the Los Angeles Basin.  If all=\n=20\ngenerators in the basin\n          contracted for capacity in this way, electric generators alone=20\nwould demand 3,316 MDth per\n          day of capacity, or 93% of SoCalGas' total receipt point capacity=\n! =20\nThere is obviously no\n          such demand today for firm service to electric generators on the=\n=20\nSoCalGas system.  Second,\n          the study assumes that the generators will make no effort to=20\nbroker, release, or sell the\n          massive amount of excess capacity that they have bought and will=\n=20\nderive no revenues from\n          such off-peak capacity sales.\n\n          Thus, the study's dire picture of the impact of demand charges on=\n=20\nlow-load factor\n     generators assumes that such generators massively over-contract for=20\ncapacity, and fail to\n     take advantage of the numerous means available under the Comprehensive=\n=20\nSettlement to\n     reduce or eliminate their demand charge risks:\n\n          The Comprehensive Settlement offers an optional backbone rate wit=\nh=20\na 50% demand\n          charge that almost halves the demand charge risk, but offers the=\n=20\nsame firm priority as the\n          SFV demand charge.\n\n          Under the comprehensive settlement, interruptible service at=20\nvolumetric rates is always\n          available at no more than a 20% premium over firm backbone rates,=\n=20\nand may even be\n          available at less than the firm backbone rates, particularly duri=\nng=20\nlow-demand periods.\n          With a backbone rate of $0.0719 per Dth, this premium is no more=\n=20\nthan $0.0144 per Dth.\n          Ms. Yap observes (in Section 2.3.1) that the interstate pipelines=\n=20\nsupplying SoCalGas have\n          at least 1,000 MMcf/d (or 30%) more capacity than SoCalGas'=20\nintrastate system.  She\n          does not recognize that SoCalGas' backbone system also has more=\n=20\nthan 900 MMcf/d of\n          excess capacity, plus substantial excess storage capacity.  Due t=\no=20\nthis excess intrastate\n          capacity, it is difficult to imagine a scenario, for the=20\nforeseeable future, in which a low-\n          load factor generator would ever have to pay more than the maximu=\nm=20\ninterruptible rate\n          for \"virtually firm\" backbone service.\n\n          I have re-calculated the results of the SCGC / TURN study, under=\n=20\nthe assumption that\n          generators in the Los Angeles basin take interruptible service, i=\nn=20\norder to avoid demand\n          charges, at the full $0.0144 per Dth premium for interruptible=20\nservice.  In this case, the\n          generators' annual fixed costs increase by just six-tenths of one=\n=20\npercent (0.6%).  In\n          reality, I expect that interruptible or released firm service wil=\nl=20\nbe available for much of the\n          year at all-volumetric rates that are much less than the maximum=\n=20\ninterruptible rate.\n\n          The Comprehensive Settlement will establish an active market for=\n=20\nthe trading of\n          backbone capacity on the SoCalGas system.  This will provide a=20\nmeans for electric\n          generators to rationalize their holdings of intrastate capacity,=\n=20\nand may be a source of firm\n          capacity at volumetric rates.  Again, the SCGC / TURN study of th=\ne=20\nimpact of demand\n          charges assumes that generators do not use this secondary market.\n\n          Ms. Yap fails to recognize that low-load factor generators will b=\ne=20\nable to avoid paying\n          demand charges (and save money on intrastate transportation, as=\n=20\nwell) by buying gas in\n          the city-gate market.  Ms. Yap's primary concern with the city-ga=\nte=20\nmarket appears to\n          be the fear that marketers will be able to charge a significant=\n=20\npremium for city-gate sales\n          during periods of capacity constraints.  SCGC / TURN, at Section=\n=20\n2.3.1. Ms. Yap's\n          testimony fails to explain her assertion that the city-gate marke=\nt=20\ncould become a\n          \"bottleneck\" on the SoCalGas system.  Upstream of the city-gate=\n=20\nmarket, SoCalGas will\n          have over 900 MMcf/d of excess backbone capacity, plus significan=\nt=20\namounts of unused\n          storage capacity.\n\n          Ms. Yap's \"bottlenecks\" and marketer-manipulated high prices have=\n=20\nnot materialized in\n          two years' of experience with the PG&E city-gate market, even=20\nthough PG&E has less\n          excess transmission capacity and far less storage capacity than=\n=20\nSoCalGas.   PG&E city-\n          gate prices did experience one brief spike, due to very high dema=\nnd=20\nduring the cold snap\n          just prior to Christmas in 1998, but on average PG&E city-gate=20\nprices have provided\n          significant benefits to end users, compared to purchases at the=\n=20\nCalifornia border.  In\n          addition, the data that Mr. Weil cites on the parties holding=20\ncapacity on the PG&E system\n          shows that 75 parties hold capacity on the Redwood path alone, an=\nd=20\ndoes not suggest any\n          undue concentration of capacity holdings on the PG&E backbone=20\nsystem.  Ibid., Table 1,\n          Section 2.2.3.\n\n          Furthermore, the Comprehensive Settlement has numerous provisions=\n=20\nto ensure that any\n          one marketer will be unlikely to accumulate a dominant share of=\n=20\ncapacity to the SoCalGas\n          city-gate market.  First, noncore end use customers will have the=\n=20\ninitial two open seasons\n          in which to subscribe to up to 50% of the available backbone=20\ncapacity, without\n          competition from marketers.  This should ensure that end users th=\nat=20\nare interested in\n          holding capacity will be able to acquire the capacity that they=\n=20\ndesire, and is likely to lead\n          to an even greater number of holders of capacity than resulted fr=\nom=20\nthe Gas Accord open\n          season, in which end users and marketers competed together. =20\nSecond, the Comprehensive\n          Settlement limits any one party from holding, at the end of the=\n=20\nopen season process, more\n          than 40% of the intrastate capacity from any individual SoCalGas=\n=20\nreceipt point.  Third, if\n          any party attempts to withhold firm intrastate capacity, in an=20\neffort to drive up prices, that\n          capacity will be available for SoCalGas to sell as interruptible=\n=20\nservice, and SoCalGas will\n          have a strong incentive to market such capacity, because it is 10=\n0%=20\nat risk for the\n          recovery of backbone transmission costs.\n\n     The SCGC / TURN testimony tries to portray low-load factor generators =\nas=20\ncaught in a\n\"price squeeze\" between capped PX prices and increased fixed operating cost=\ns=20\ndue to the\nimposition of demand charges for intrastate transmission.  SCGC / TURN,=20\nSection 2.4.3.  The\ntestimony paints a grim picture of plants closing, and jobs lost, in the Lo=\ns=20\nAngeles Basin.\nHowever, there are a number of elements in this picture that simply do not=\n=20\nadd up:\n\n=0F0    The testimony appears to assume that low-load factor generators pay=\n the=20\nSFV demand\n     charges, and take none of the steps discussed above to mitigate or=20\neliminate the impact of\n     demand charges.\n\n=0F0    The testimony does not recognize that there will be a $3 million do=\nllar=20\nreduction in rates to\n     the EG class as a result of the Comprehensive Settlement.\n\n=0F0    The testimony asserts that the increases in operating costs as a re=\nsult=20\nof demand charges will\n     be serious enough to force plants to close.  Even accepting SCGC /=20\nTURN's inflated figure\n     of a 20% increase in fixed costs, SCGC / TURN provide no financial dat=\na=20\nthat substantiates\n     their assertion that an increase of this magnitude is likely to force =\na=20\nsignificant number of\n     plants to close.\n\n=0F0    SCGC / TURN fail to appreciate the logical way to avoid the \"price=\n=20\nsqueeze\" that they so\n     fear: buy gas in the SoCalGas city-gate market.  City-gate buyers will=\n=20\navoid paying demand\n     charges, so their fixed operating costs will not increase.  In additio=\nn,=20\nthe SoCalGas city-gate\n     market is likely to be the gas market that is most tightly linked to=\n=20\nelectric prices in southern\n     California, because it will be the closest market to the generators'=\n=20\npoint of consumption and\n     because almost 60% of noncore loads on the SoCalGas / SDG&E system are=\n=20\nelectric\n     generators.  As a result, generators buying gas in the SoCalGas=20\ncity-gate market will have\n     the highest assurance that changes in their gas costs will be reflecte=\nd=20\nin changes in electric\n     prices, thus reducing the risk of a \"price squeeze between gas and=20\nelectric prices.  This has\n     certainly been the case in northern California.  Straightforward=20\nstatistical analyses that I have\n     performed show that the PG&E city-gate gas price is more highly=20\ncorrelated to PX electric\n     prices than are gas prices in any other market in the state, presumabl=\ny=20\nbecause electric\n     generators in northern California use that market and because it is th=\ne=20\nclosest market to the\n     generators' burner tips.\n\n=0F0    SCGC / TURN attempt to argue that the closure of low-load factor pl=\nants=20\nin the Los\n     Angeles Basin, due to the imposition of demand charges, will have=20\nserious implications for\n     electric reliability.  SCGC / TURN, at Section 2.4.5. At the same time=\n,=20\nSCGC / TURN argue\n     that generators will not be able to recover demand charges because les=\ns=20\nthan 20% of the\n     capacity in the basin is under Reliability Must-Run (RMR) contracts an=\nd=20\nthat there is\n     \"intense competition\" for available RMR contracts.  Yet the lack of RM=\nR=20\ncontracts in the\n     basin is due to the fact that there is enough capacity in the basin to=\n=20\nprovide more-than-\n     adequate reliability and to assure that few generators can exercise=20\nlocal market power.  If\n     some generators in the Los Angeles Basin go out of business due to=20\ndemand charges, a more\n     likely scenario than blackouts is that PX prices will rise in southern=\n=20\nCalifornia, the ISO will\n     make available more RMR contracts in the basin, and those contracts wi=\nll=20\nprovide a higher\n     level of cost recovery, thus offsetting the impact of the demand charg=\nes.\n\n     This completes my rebuttal testimony."

InPower made the filing stating it \nestimated that IPPs in MAIN (and, specifically, Wisconsin) could supply a \nsubstantial portion of the summer energy shortfalls (FERC did not limit \nImPower to IPPs in MAIN).  InPower did not name any specific IPPs; however, \nto be eligible under ImPower's program, an IPP must control generation \nprimarily for the purpose of meeting on-site demand or providing back-up \ngeneration and have such generation located on its premises or premises \napproved by the local utility.  Further, the generation must be capable of \nproducing electricity either synchronous with the local utilities' grid or \ncommensurate with agreements with the local utility.  Total sales made by \nIPPs in ImPower's program would not exceed 1000 MW/ hour.  The IPPs are in \nbusinesses other than the sale of electricity and are simply seeking \n\"incremental return on the often-unused capacity of their generation assets.\"\n\nWhen an IPP participates in ImPower's program, it becomes subject to FERC's \njurisdiction as a \"public utility.\"  \n\nJacksonville Electric Authority (JEA) protested ImPower's filing stating it \nallows retail customers to arbitrage retail and wholesale power markets by \npurchasing power at average, embedded cost retail rates and simultaneously \nusing their generating facilities to sell power at wholesale to ImPower (at \npeak times).  FERC addressed JEA's concerns by saying that the IPPs cannot \nviolate any rules and requirements properly imposed on the retail sales made \nto those suppliers.\n\nThis order allows ImPower (as an aggregator) to make the required quarterly \nfilings for the IPPs and the IPPs do not have to apply for separate market \nbased rates authority.  The are some additional reporting requirements FERC \nwaived for the IPPs: accounting and reporting, issuance of securities and \ninterlocking directorates (an affidavit is still needed).  I do not know if \nthe IPPs are still required to become Exempt Wholesale Generators (EWGs), but \nwill check on that.  EWG approval takes 60 days (plus filing preparation \ntime).\n\nThe Enron Industrial group may want to consider making a similar type of \nfiling.  Please let me know if you would like a copy of the filing or order."

          "body": "As most of you know, I met this morning with SFA:\n\nto bring them up to speed with recent developments within Enron Europe (we \nhave a regulatory obligation to keep SFA informed); and\n\nas a forerunner to the SFA inspection scheduled to take place at Enron House \non 20 and 21 July.          \n\nThe meeting was positive, friendly and constructive.  The key points coming \nout of the meeting are as follows:\n\n1.  Regulatory Capital\n\nThis did not feature in the discussion at all and I did not raise the issue.  \nI suspect we are unlikely to hear more on this from SFA until the July \ninspection (at the earliest).\n\n2. Enron's new SFA procedures\n\nI delivered to SFA a file containing the new SFA procedures we have produced \nfor each relevant group within Enron Europe; I also described the change in \nour SFA officers and our efforts to build a \"compliance culture\".  SFA were \nclearly impressed with the new procedures and indicated that our approach was \na good one, given the increase in our size, staff movements etc.  They said \nthey are trying to introduce their own written procedures within SFA!\n\n3. SFA's July Inspection\n\nThis was described as being an \"overview visit\" which would last two days \n(possibly slightly longer) and be carried out by Karen Wilson (our \nrelationship manager at SFA), plus two others.  The purpose of the inspection \nis for SFA to assess the extent of our compliance systems, processes and \nculture.  I have been asked to provide to SFA, before the inspection, a \ndescription of our European businesses and a list of those people who we \nthink it would be useful for SFA to meet.  Note, however, that SFA will be \nfree to speak to anyone they wish to, to assess our level of compliance \nawareness.  We will therefore need to embark on an extensive internal \neducation program before July to make sure all relevant staff understand and \nimplement our new procedures which the group heads have approved.\n\nOur procedures, policies and documents will all be reviewed by SFA, but at a \nfairly high level.  There will be an initial meeting with SFA and a close out \nmeeting at the end of the inspection which will highlight areas of deficiency \n(they always find some) which we will then have several weeks to put right.  \nThey will wish to know whether we can \"weather a financial storm\"; they will \nwish to assess the quality of our management and management systems; and they \nwill wish to check on our systems generally (e.g. how much is automated, how \nmuch involves manual checking).  They will also review our then current \nfinancial return and accounting records to ensure they are being properly \nprepared.  Any serious breaches discovered could lead to further \ninvestigation and disciplining/penalties, but the purpose of the inspection \nis, in their words, not \"to trip us up\".\n\nOverall, they will be forming an impression of Enron and will give us a one \nto five ranking depending on how comfortable they feel with our compliance.  \nThis will determine how they treat Enron going forward (i.e. the more \ncomfortable they feel, the fewer visits we can expect).\n\n4. Recent Developments at Enron\n\nI highlighted a number of recent developments within Enron, stressing the \nphysical (unregulated) aspect of our business (e.g. sale of Sutton Bridge).  \nThey agreed that, given our unique mixture of physical and financial \nbusinesses, there are no comparators for Enron.  \n\nInterestingly, they were already aware of Enron Online even though we had not \nnotified them about it.  They did not seem concerned about Enron Online, but \nsaid that the system was one thing (among others) they would wish to take a \nlook at during the July inspection.\n\n\n Paul "

I believe that the filing is specific enough to \naddress the Commission's concerns because we have narrowed it down to a \nspecific portion of a specific pipeline in order to help alleviate a \nconstraint on TW's system.

There is a feeling that if we make a big \ndeal of this with FERC, then they will ask a lot of questions about why we \naren't filing for permission.  Hopefully, if we explain that it doesn't \nchange any of our current practices, that its just a new computer tool, they \nwill chalk it up as another ecommerce story.  \n\nI hope to talk about the GPG's use of EOL generally and not get deep into the \nmechanics of the specific TW auction.  The advantage of me doing the FERC \nbriefing is that I can talk generally and claim that I'm not privy to the \ndetails of each of the pipelines possible EOL products.\n\nAttached is a rough outline of my message points and a few Q&As that I have \nthought of thus far.  Please send me your feedback (by noon on Tues. May 30) \nand any other Q&As that you think I should be prepared for. \n\n \n\n"

          "body": "Let me clarify two of the more substantive matters that were not included in \nthe errata - Wheeler Ridge and the Pooling Revisions.? The first, Wheeler \nRidge, was not included in the errata because of concerns expressed by IP and \nORA about the impact these changes would have on Kern River shippers.? \nSoCalGas did not oppose the revision and would accept the language as \nproposed by PG&E, especially if it would gain their non-opposition.? There \nwas also a concern expressed by some parties that the WR revisions went \nbeyond the bounds of an errata and should be considered a revision of the \nsettlement.?? As for the Pooling Revisions, Dynegy expressed reservations \nabout the proposed changes that included substantial increases in the number \nof pools available per shipper.? Dynegy was not able to garner internal \napproval in time for us to prepare the errata for filing later today, so \nPooling revisions were taken off the table.? SoCalGas supports the pooling \nrevisions and no other party expressed any concerns.? ALJ Biren asked us to \nfile a revised settlement document with the corrected pages included and to \nmail it out to the parties today, so our already compressed deadline for \ngetting this out the door was even more compressed.? \n\nSince I was unable to get resolution from all of the parties of the \noutstanding differences, I could not include the revisions that were \ncirculated (to our dismay).? PG&E has now indicated they will file limited \nopposition and they have now served a discovery request upon SoCalGas with \nregard to Wheeler Ridge.\n\n\n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Craig Chancellor [mailto:craigc@calpine.com] \nSent: Friday, April 28, 2000 8:15 AM \nTo: 'Cherry, Brian - TPBKC'; 'AlexanMS@sce.com'; 'paulamirault@aec.ca'; \n'david.bayless@utility.com'; 'Tomb@crossborderenergy.com'; \n'Burkee@cts.com'; Craig Chancellor; 'Rick.Counihan@greenmountain.com'; \n'Jdasovic@enron.com'; 'Mday@gmssr.com'; 'bdingwall@unitedgas.com'; \n'Douglass@arterhadden.com'; 'eke@aelaw.com'; 'Jfawcet@enron.com'; \n'rfoss@coral-energy.com'; 'plg@cpuc.ca.gov'; 'johnj@bcjlaw.com'; \n'Johnson_Pamela@lacoe.edu'; 'karpjos@sf.whitecase.com'; \n'jleslie@luce.com'; 'kmccrea@sablaw.com'; 'jmpa@dynegy.com'; \n'rmp@cpuc.ca.gov'; 'porterdk@sce.com'; 'RochmanM@cubjpa.org'; \n'RochmanM@spurr.org'; 'susan.scott@enron.com'; Beamish, Richard - TPRMB; \nBetonte, Robert - TP2RSB; Brill, Thomas R.; Cotton, Gary; Davis, Robert \nE.; Davis, Steven D.; Fair, Pam; Follett, B.

FERC should be \nspending 90% of its time fixing fundamental structural rules in the electric \nside and 10% refining rules on the gas side.    That is not to say that there \naren't important revisions that the FERC should take up on the gas side.  \nThese fixes, however, can be characterized as refinements, as contrasted with \nthe fundamental changes we seek on the electric side.  Moreover, these \nchanges may largely be addressed by the recent Order 637.  \n\nWith respect to E-commerce, I believe that the Enron message is that the FERC \nshould  fix the structural problems and get out of the way - e-commerce will \ncome and in most cases is already here.\n\nDave Forster of EnronOnLine will be making a presentation that focuses on how \nmuch more liquid gas is than power, as evidenced by tight spreads.  In \nprevious presentations to FERC folks, Steve Kean has made the point that \nwhile the rules are far from perfect on the gas side (i.e. tariffs are still \nnot standardized), the market works because FERC got the basic structural \nrules right (i.e. 636 unbundling). \n\nI think all your areas of improvement are appropriate (of course I don't \nnecessarily like them as a pipeliner), but I think they fit the overall Enron \nmessage if presented as a list of refinements.   I plan to speak to them \nabout competitive pressures our pipeline face,  our current web sites, plans \nfor Order 637 postings and intraday capacity release.  \n\nHere are my  thoughts on getting your points across within the overall \ntheme.  I'm also sending out a separate email outline of the day.  \n\n \n"

The primary issues that I see are as follows:\n\n (1) whether new generation projects require a certificate of need or similar \ngrant of authority from state authorities, and if so, what is entailed in \nobtaining  such authority ;\n\n (2) the degree to which, if any, the owners of such projects fall within the \nregulatory jurisdiction of state PUCs (as a public utility or otherwise);\n\n (3) whether there are state siting requirements (and if so, what are they); \nand \n\n (4) an assessment of local zoning requirements.\n\nObviously, there may also be environmental permitting issues as well - is \nthat something you are looking for a state-by-state assessment of as well?\n\nI will send to you a memo that was prepared recently for ENA/Pulp & Paper \nrelative to a small generation project in Wisconsin.  The purpose of sending \nyou the memo is to determine whether the issues analyzed in that context are \nsimilar to those you are confronting.

My recollection is that the 25% was used as a \nbenchmark to estimate ECS' fee but was never established as a firm rule.\n\nECS is supposed to provide us with their own written explanation for the \n$500k reduction.  They are also supposed to send us the \"re-negotiated\" rate \nschedule 21 that shows the transmission demand charge becoming avoidable.\n\nIn any event, whether it is reasonable or not that ECS is due the $500k, it \nis reasonable to expect that ET&S would have been notified of this change in \na more timely manner.\n\n\nDave Foti\nx.31978\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

For example, the\n\n     Petition asserts:\n\n          Concepts such as ATC and the OASIS have become vehicles\n          for obstructing and curtailing, rather than\n          accommodating, transactions.  Incumbents are able to\n          deny new entrants access to critical, accurate\n          information across control areas.  This can take the\n          form of out-of-date or incorrect postings of ATC or, in\n          some instances, intentional withholding of actual ATC. \n          Regardless of the cause, more transmission capability\n\n\n\n     111/ Open Access Same Time Information Technical Conference,\n          Docket No. RM95-9-003 (July 18, 1997), transcript at 23.\n\n     112/ Id. at 28.\n\n     113/ The group consists of a number of power marketers and users,\n          including, for example, Coalition for a Competitive Electric\n          Market, ELCON, Electric Clearinghouse, Inc., and Enron Power\n          Marketing, Inc.\n\n     114/ Petition for a Rulemaking on Electric Power Industry\n          Structure and Commercial Practices and Motion to Clarify or\n          Reconsider Certain Open-Access Commercial Practices, Docket\n          No. RM98-5-000.\n\n\n          Docket No. RM99-2-000              - 73 -         \n\n          is physically available than is being released for\n          sale. [115/]\n\n     The Petition alleges the existence of \"ATC exclusions,\n\n     inaccuracies and misuses that deny new entrants the ability to\n\n     evaluate market opportunities, and therefore, prevent reasonable\n\n     access to the grid.\" 116/  The Petition cited specific instances\n\n     of inconsistent ATC calculations for the same interconnection by\n\n     the systems on either side; an OASIS showing ATC that was not in\n\n     fact made available for scheduling; and an OASIS showing no ATC\n\n     but the utility then using that path for a sale. 117/\n\n          EPSA, the trade association representing certain power\n\n     suppliers, filed comments in support of the Petition and echoed\n\n     many of the same experiences:\n\n          EPSA agrees that this discriminatory conduct persists\n          principally because of the continuing incentives and\n          opportunity for transmission owning public utilities\n          covertly to discriminate against other transmission\n          customers, by, for example, minimizing reported\n          available transmission capability (ATC), delaying or\n          inaccurately posting ATC on the OASIS, or otherwise\n          manipulating market operations. 118/\n\n     EPSA further stated that, \"The manipulation of ATC -- whether\n\n     with the intent to deceive or as the result of poor OASIS\n\n\n\n\n\n     115/ Petition at 7-8.\n\n     116/ Id. at 15.\n\n     117/ Id. at Appendix D.\n\n     118/ EPSA Comments, Docket No. RM98-5-000, at 2 (filed September\n          21, 1998).\n\n\n          Docket No. RM99-2-000              - 74 -         \n\n     management -- is a serious entrance barrier for competitive power\n\n     suppliers.\" 119/\n\n          At our regional ISO conference in New Orleans, we were told\n\n     by a representative from the Public Service Commission of Yazoo\n\n     City, Mississippi, of a specific instance of what it considered\n\n     to be discriminatory treatment:\n\n          Yazoo City, as a participant, has experienced first\n          hand an individual [transmission] owner's continued\n          ability to use its ownership and control [of]\n          transmission to disadvantage competitors,\n          notwithstanding Order 888's mandate of\n          non-discriminatory transmission access. \n\n     The representative then went on to describe an instance where a\n\n     marketer could not complete a 10 MW power sale because of\n\n     transmission restrictions, but then the transmission provider\n\n     offered to supply the capacity itself. 120/  The representative\n\n     concluded that Orders Nos. 888 and 889 have not fully eliminated\n\n     undue discrimination and this will not be achieved \"as long as\n\n     transmission owners are allowed to fence in\n\n     transmission-dependent utilities and others located on their\n\n     transmission system to enhance the value of their generation\n\n     assets at increased cost to competitors.\" \n\n\n     119/ Id. at 8.\n\n     120/ Comments of Robert D. Priest on behalf of the Public Service\n          Commission of Yazoo City, Regional ISO Conference (New\n          Orleans), Transcript at 201-03.  After hearing this\n          assertion, Entergy Services, Inc. filed a letter in which it\n          stated that it was unable to identify any Entergy-imposed\n          restrictions that would have prevented the power purchase. \n          See Letter in Docket No. PL98-5-000 (filed July 2, 1998). \n\n\n          Docket No. RM99-2-000              - 75 -         \n\n          One specific area where there have been allegations that\n\n     transmission owners are using ATC to favor their own merchant\n\n     operations concerns the calculation and use of Capacity Benefit\n\n     Margin (CBM).  Although there is no single accepted definition,\n\n     CBM is generally used to mean an amount of transmission transfer\n\n     capability reserved by load serving entities to ensure access to\n\n     generation from interconnected systems to meet their generation\n\n     reliability requirements. 121/  Some utilities subtract CBM from\n\n     their total transmission capability to arrive at ATC.  There is\n\n     no uniform method for calculating CBM.  The ability to withhold\n\n     CBM to ensure reliability not only confers a reliability\n\n     advantage for the transmission provider, but may give the\n\n     transmission provider the opportunity to selectively withhold ATC\n\n     over paths and interconnections useful to its generation\n\n     competitors.  \n\n          The use of CBM is an issue that is currently being\n\n     considered in several cases pending before the Commission. 122/ \n\n     For example, with respect to the formation of the PJM ISO, the\n\n     Commission noted that it was not demonstrated that the PJM Pool's\n\n     historical practice of withholding firm transmission interface\n\n     capacity as a substitute for installed generating reserves is\n\n\n     121/ NERC, Available Transfer Capability Definitions and\n          Determinations (June 1996), at 14.\n\n     122/ The Commission recently noticed a technical conference, to\n          be held May 20 and 21, 1999, on the issue of CBM.  See\n          Capacity Benefit Margin in Computing Available Transmission\n          Capacity, Notice of Technical Conference, Docket No. EL99-\n          46-000.\n\n\n          Docket No. RM99-2-000              - 76 -         \n\n     consistent with our open access policies.  The Commission\n\n     observed that the load serving entities that own generating\n\n     capacity within the PJM control area appeared to benefit from\n\n     this practice as suppliers in addition to benefitting as load\n\n     serving entities. 123/  The Commission set the issue for further\n\n     briefing and it remains pending.  In another pending proceeding\n\n     concerning WPSC's CBM calculation, two of the parties assert that\n\n     CBM \"removes firm transmission capacity from open access\n\n     offerings, thereby raising an unnecessary and unjustifiable\n\n     barrier to competition,\" and \"fosters discrimination by giving\n\n     merchant functions gatekeeping control over CBM-related\n\n     transmission access and by giving individual interface\n\n     transmission owners broad discretion over where and how much CBM\n\n     is withdrawn from ATC.\" 124/  In the same proceeding, Electric\n\n     Clearinghouse, Inc. asserts that \"the CBM set-aside embodies\n\n     undue discrimination in access to the monopoly owned transmission\n\n     wires because it ensures certain users a priority over the\n\n     reserved transmission interface capacity to the exclusion of\n\n     other firm transmission users.\" 125/\n\n          As we stated above, we fully recognize that these are\n\n     assertions made in pending cases in which we have not yet made\n\n\n\n     123/ PJM, 81 FERC at 62,277.\n\n     124/ Protest of Madison Gas & Electric Company and Wisconsin\n          Public Power Inc., Docket No. EL98-2-003, at 3 (filed August\n          21, 1998).\n\n     125/ Protest of Electric Clearinghouse, Inc., Docket No. EL98-2-\n          003, at 3 (filed August 21, 1998).\n\n\n          Docket No. RM99-2-000              - 77 -         \n\n     findings.  They are referenced here as illustrative of the\n\n     suspicions in the industry of continuing opportunities for\n\n     discriminatory treatment that may disadvantage certain\n\n     competitors where generation owners continue to operate\n\n     transmission.\n\n\n\n"

          "body": "Not much has happened with the federal filings since we submitted them (SEC \napplication was filed on February 4, FERC application was filed on March 3).  \nAnn has been keeping everyone updated on the DOJ review of the HSR filing.  \n\nWith regard to the FERC filing, FERC separated the section 203 merger \napplication from the section 205 joint open access tariff filing.   \nInterventions and protests to the joint transmission tariff (which will be \nused by the merged companies once the merger occurs), were due to be filed at \nthe end of March.  Interventions and protests to the section 203 application \nare due May 3.  \n\nOne party asked FERC to extend the deadline for interventions and protests on \nthe tariff to be extended to May 3, and FERC granted that request.  However, \nseveral parties filed interventions before FERC granted the extension, so \nsome comments have been filed.  The only significant substantive comment came \nfrom the Public Utility Commission of Nevada (PUCN).  PUCN opposes the \nmerging parties' license plate rate proposal and instead favors a rolled-in \nrate structure (where the rates of the three individual systems -- Nevada \nPower, Sierra Pacific, and Portland General) are averaged together so that \ntransmission customers on any of the three systems would pay the same \ntransmission rate, regardless of which system they use.  \n\nWe have some answers to this protest.  First, one of FERC's main concerns \nwith regard to transmission rates is the elimination of pancaked rates \n(paying multiple transmission rates for moving over multiple systems).  The \njoint open access tariff eliminates pancaking and uses instead a license \nplate approach (pay the rate of the system where the power is being delivered \nand have transmission access over all three systems for that one rate).  \nSecond, if the rates are averaged together, rate payers in the low cost \nregion will pay a higher transmission rate.  Third, depending on the RTO \nconfiguration, PGE could be in a separate RTO from Sierra and Nevada, so \ndifferent rates, at least for PGE, would be warranted.  \n\nWe plan on filing an answer to the PUCN protest at the same time we file an \nanswer to the other protests and comments that will be filed on May 3.   FERC \ndoes not typically allow answers to protests, so we did not want to submit \nmultiple answers to the various pleadings.  We expect the majority of \nprotests to be filed in the section 203 merger application docket.  Once we \nsee the extent of the protests, we will have a better idea of whether FERC \nshould be able to issue an order on the merger by the end of July (before \nthey leave for August recess).\n\nThe SEC proceeding has been quiet.  There are four major mergers ahead of our \napplication (AEP/CSW, Energy East, NSP/New Century, ComEd/PECO), so we do not \nexpect the SEC to focus on our filing until they are closer to ruling on \nthese other mergers.  \n\nWe will keep you posted on any significant events on the federal side.  In \nthe meantime, please call or email me if you have any questions.\n\nSarah\n"

This would effectively operate as an \nexpansion of TW's system from the San Juan Basin to the mainline.  TW would \nacquire PNM capacity then post it as available on the EBB just like we post \nother capacity.  Shippers could then use the capacity to transport gas from \nBlanco to any point on TW's system.   The capacity that PNM has available at \nthis time is seasonal (summer months) only, so it would be used to provide \nshort-term firm capacity or LFT to TW customers.   The marketers anticipate \nthat the additional capacity would mostly be used to ship gas to points on \nTW's mainline besides Rio Puerco -- in other words, the total path used by \nshippers would be a combination of PNM's system and TW's system.  Shippers \nwouldn't necessarily know whether PNM capacity was being used to provide \nservice on their contract, only that their gas is being shipped from A to B.  \n\nIn re-reading the Texas Eastern line of cases, I believe we can distinguish \nTW's proposal from that in Northern's Docket No. 97-388 because it is more \nspecific (we are asking for authority to acquire capacity on a specific \npipeline) and because it is more in the nature of an expansion of TW's \nconstrained San Juan lateral rather than a proposal to broker other \npipelines' capacity.  I may be overly optimistic, but I also believe we meet \nall the Texas Eastern criteria.\n\nI realize that I have not discussed this very extensively (or at all) with \nany of you, but I have gone ahead and drafted the proposal in the form of a \nletter to FERC.  It seemed the most efficient way to provide a starting point \nfor discussion, especially since I was able to borrow heavily from our \nsuccessful Market Center Services filing.  I'm not yet sure where we will \ninclude it in the tariff, but I propose tariff language along the lines of   \n\"Transporter may contract for firm transportation service on Public Service \nCompany of New Mexico for use in providing transportation service from the \nBlanco receipt point on Transporter's system.

It is available on the Publications page of my website: \nwww.EHirst.com.\n\nThe key problems I identify include:  \n\nDeclining generation reserve margins,  \n\nDeclining transmission capacity relative to load, leading to  \n\nIncreasing transmission congestion, and  \n\nGrowing number and complexity of bulk-power transactions.  \n\nThe primary solutions I discuss include:  \n\nFederal legislation to (1) extend FERC authority over the entire bulk-power \nindustry for reliability and (2) oversee a single North American reliability \norganization that sets mandatory standards;  \n\nLarge regional transmission organizations;  \n\nDecide who decides where and when to build new transmission lines, with \nregional solutions? likely better than local ones; and?  \n\nExpand demand-side participation in energy and ancillary-service markets.  \n\n\n\nPlease let me know if you have any comments on the paper.\n\nEric\n----------------------------------------------\nEric Hirst\nConsulting in Electric-Industry Restructuring\n106 Capital Circle\nOak Ridge, TN 37830\n865-482-5470 (phone & fax)???

          "body": "On 5/17/00, FERC issued an order accepting Entergy's pro forma \ninterconnection agreement (\"IA\") and procedures subject to modification.  As \nI mentioned earlier, Entergy had adopted some of Enron's suggestion (in \nEnron's comments), including limiting emergencies to not include Entergy's \nloss of generation.\n\nAll transmission must be separately arranged through OASIS -- it is not \nincluded with an interconnection request.\nEntergy's interconnection policy will apply to generators that will serve \nwholesale, as well as unbundled retail.\nDismisses EPSA's call for a \"model\" and approves Entergy's pro forma \ninterconnection agreement, subject to modification.\nAgreed with Enron that billing disputes should be placed in escrow, not paid \nto Entergy subject to refund (FERC said that the IA should conform to other \naspects of the Order No. 888 tariff--for example, Entergy and customer are \nresponsible for their own negligence).\nHolds that all other terms of the Order No. 888 pro forma tariff apply to the \nIA, even if  the IA does not repeat all those provisions.\nClarifies Tenn. Power case that if a generator connects first and another \ngenerator subsequently connects in the same local area and the grid cannot \naccommodate \"receipt\" of power without expansion, the new generator must pay \ncosts of expansion.\nEntergy is required to revise IA to make distinction as to which provisions \nare pure \"interconnection\" and which are applicable when \ntransmission/delivery is also requested (on OASIS).\nEntergy is required to attempt to complete the interconnection studies in a \nspecific timeline (60 days for 1st iteration --system impact), and to provide \na statement that Entergy will notify applicant of any delay with an \nexplanation for the delay (Entergy had included no timelines).\nIf applicant and Entergy cannot agree on IA terms, Entergy must file the \nunexecuted agreement at FERC for FERC to decide.\nFERC will not initiate a \"generic\" proceeding at this time, but encourages \nall transmission providers to file procedures at FERC.\nApproves Entergy's credits for \"optional\" upgrades (required to transport \npower away from the plant), but requires Entergy to file an explanation of \nhow the credits work.\nEntergy will only include prior queued interconnection requests in subsequent \nstudies once they have signed an interconnection agreement (to show more \nintent to actually complete the project).  This does not mean that failure to \nexecute an IA results in removal from the queue, just that the generator may \nbe subject to different actual interconnection costs when it connects.  This \nis a risk that FERC says is inherent in interconnection.  Entergy will also \npost its queue on OASIS.\nReactive power must only be supplied when generator is operating.\nEntergy cannot keep the initial $10,000 deposit, unless actual costs are \n$10,000 or greater (generator must pay actual costs of studies).\nPer Enron's comments, Entergy must pay for energy taken during an emergency \n(or explain why that is inappropriate).\nPer Enron's comments, Entergy must explain the requirement that the generator \npays for subsequent changes to Entergy's transmission system.\n\nEntergy must submit a compliance tariff within 30 days.  Let me know if you \nwould like a copy of the order."

In essence, \nthe issue is that the utility should not have the unilateral right to \ndisclose any information to anyone they want that is sent to them in \nconnection with a DG interconnection.  This would include ownership, facility \noutput, markets for energy or capacity or ancillary sevices (if any) and \nmaintenance schedules (these schedules may be coincident with a retail \ncustomer's facility maintenance schedule which itself may be confidential \ninformation between the generator and retail customer).  This information is \npotentially competitive and should be held confidential.

This dispute and the even more significant \ndispute over SEC-CFTC jurisdiction (the Accord) are the most significant \nremaining issues with the legislation.  In that context, you may be aware \nthat the CFTC and SEC reported to Congress yesterday that they have not been \nable to work out the Accord issues.  We were informed prior to our meeting \nthis morning that the House and Senate bills on CFTC reauthorization are \nlikely to be introduced today.  I will transmit copies as soon as I get \nthem.   It is my understanding that both bills do a good job for us with \nrespect to legal certainty for energy and other nonfinancial commodities.\n\nIn this light, we met with the CFTC and reviewed with them the attached \ntwo-page legislative proposal.  The most significant problem that we have is \nthe CFTC's discomfort at providing an exclusion for bilateral, nonfinancial \ntransactions.  In essence, the CFTC does not want to go beyond the \nrecommendations of the President's Working Group.  We have continued to \ninsist that nonfinancial bilateral transactions be treated like financial \nbilateral transactions and be carved out of CFTC jurisdiction.  Our meeting \nwas very cordial and the CFTC said that they would be taking our comments \ninto consideration.  Unfortunately, inability to get passed the bilateral \nissue effectively forecloses resolution of the other issues in our outline.\n\nSeparately, we understand the CFTC is moving forward with its regulatory \nrelief package which they hope to publish sometime next week.  We understand \nthat it will be published with a 45-day comment period.\n\nFurther updates to follow.\n\n\n\n----------------------------------\n\nThis e-mail is sent by a law firm and contains information\nthat may be privileged and confidential.

If proposed, however, seasonal rates must be cost \njustified.  I did not come across any particular discussion of what kinds of \nproof are necessary (you had asked about the time period for actual sales and \nelasticity of demand).  I have included a few paragraphs below from FERC \norders that discuss seasonal rates, which may be useful to you.  Please let \nus know if you would like us to look into this any further.  Andrea\n\nRelated to 205/206\n\nALJ-DEC, 35 FERC ?63,076, Union Electric Company, Docket No. ER84-560-000, \n(June 04, 1986)\n[65,264]\n\n It might be noted that UE could have established a seasonal/time-of-day rate \nwith cost justification or by explaining its departure from cost-based rates. \nIn Commonwealth Edison, the Presiding Judge rejected a higher seasonal demand \ncharge for the summer because it was not cost justified. He also held, \nhowever, that where the rate design is not intended to reflect costs, the \napplicant \"must justify the departure from cost-based rates. 18 C.F.R. o35.\n13(b)(4)(iii).\" 15 FERC ?63,048, at p. 65,229 (1981).\n\nUE made a valiant effort to comply. It attempted to relate the off-peak costs \nto on-peak by its 50 percent discount argument and reference to its Exhibits \nUE-28 and UE-19. These exhibits amply justify the on-peak costs but offer no \ncost support for the off-peak discount. This discount is chosen as a matter \nof judgment. A similar proposal was rejected by the Presiding Judge in \nCommonwealth Edison. Id.\n\nAlthough the argument of a \"free ride\" deserves consideration, based on the \nrecord we have here and in the absence of a detailed cost justification, UE's \noff-peak demand charge is rejected.\n\n REVERSED - see next paragraph\n\nCOMM-OPINION-ORDER, 40 FERC ?61,046, Union Electric Company, Docket No. \nER84-560-000, (July 20, 1987)\n\nUnion's proposal to assess a capacity charge for off-peak service under \nspecified circumstances (when a customer's off-peak demand exceeds twice its \nhighest measured peak demand) not only reflects the fact that customers use \nthe company's production and transmission plant off-peak and capacity-related \ncosts are incurred during those times, but also recognizes the equity \nconsideration created by the existence of the peak shaving option to certain \ncustomers. Upon consideration of the evidence presented and the merits of the \narguments raised by the parties, we reverse the judge's ruling and allow the \noff-peak billing demand provision. Although we are approving Union's use of \nan off-peak billing demand provision, the Commission nevertheless believes \nthat a strong incentive continues to exist for customers to peak shave and, \nthus, realize cost savings. Furthermore, although we adopt Union's approach \nas reasonable within the context of this case, this is not to say that only \nsuch an approach is appropriate or that this approach is preferred.\n\n\n\nCOMM-OPINION-ORDER, 11 FERC ?61,083, Florida Power Corporation, Docket No. \nER80-206, (Apr. 25, 1980)\nurging rejection of FPC's proposed rate increase.\n\nOn February 12, 1980, the Public Service Commission of the State of Florida \nfiled a letter noting the absence of proposals relating to peak load pricing \n(time-of-day and seasonal rate differentials) in FPC's submittal. 5 The \nPublic Service Commission urged our review of the issues of time-of-day and \nseasonal pricing in this proceeding.\n\nWe note that the questions of time-of-day and seasonal pricing are proper \nsubjects for the hearing ordered below if any party chooses to pursue them, \nincluding the Florida Commission should it petition to intervene late in this \nproceeding.\n\nCOMM-OPINION-ORDER, 6 FERC ?61,292, Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket No. \nER79-182, (Mar. 30, 1979)\n[61,695]\n\nOur review of Commonwealth's filing indicates that the proposed rates have \nnot been shown to be just and reasonable and may be unjust, unreasonable, \nunduly discriminatory or otherwise unlawful. Therefore, we shall accept the \nproposed rates for filing and suspend those rates for five months, to become \neffective, subject to refund, on September 1, 1979.\n\nWe note with interest that the proposed rates are designed on a time-of-day \nand seasonal basis. The Commission has encouraged the use of innovative rate \ndesign as a way of more closely matching rates to costs and thereby \nminimizing misallocation of resources as well as reducing waste, inequity and \ndiscrimination. 4 We therefore direct the Presiding Administrative Law Judge \nto insure that the parties fully address the issues raised related to the \ncost support for the time-of-day and seasonal rate design.\n\nFED-REGS, FERCSR ?13,963, FPA, Regulations 18 CFR Sec. 35.13 Filing of \nchanges in rate schedules.\n\n[11,299]\n\nshall fully support all such data and shall explain the rationale and the \nspecific application proposed.\n\n(vii) Based upon information reported in Statements BB and BC, the utility \nshall list selected months that are normally the months of greatest \nsignificance in determining the need of the utility for power supply \ncapability throughout the year. All twelve months may be selected, if \nappropriate. In its selection, the utility shall take into account any \neffects of local weather seasons and, particularly, the extent to which peak \ndemands may tend to be similar in magnitude in two or more months of a \nweather season. The utility shall explain the reasons for the selections and \ndescribe the significance for the selections of seasonal variations in the \nweather.\n\nREG-PREAMBLE, FERCSR ?31,044, Inquiry Concerning the Commission's Merger \nPolicy Under the Federal Power Act: Policy Statement, Order No. 592, December \n18, 1996, Docket No. RM96-6-000, 18 CFR 2, 61 FR 68595 PART 01 OF 02.\n1. Identify the relevant products\n\nThe first step is to identify one or more products sold by the merging \nentities. Products may be grouped together when they are good substitutes for \neach other from the buyer's perspective. If two products are not good \nsubstitutes, an entity with market power can raise the price of one product \nand buyers would have a limited ability to shift their purchases to other \nproducts. In the past, the Commission has analyzed three products: non-firm \nenergy, short-term capacity (firm energy), and long-term capacity. 75 These \nremain reasonable products under the prevailing institutional arrangements, \nand applicants should recognize such products in their analysis. Other \nproduct definitions may also be acceptable. For example, the lack of on-site \nbuyer storage creates products differentiated by time. Thus, peak and \noff-peak energy (seasonal and daily) may be distinct products.\n\n\nALJ-DEC, 15 FERC ?63,048, Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket Nos. ER79-182 \nand ER80-106, (June 03, 1981) PART 02 OF 02.\n\n It is Commission policy that rate design reflect cost incurrence, Idaho \nPower Co., Opinion No. 13, issued May 4, 1978, mimeo at 26; Minnesota Power \nand Light Co., Opinion No. 12, issued April 14, 1978, mimeo at 24-5.\n\n[65,229]\n\n\nIn both cases, the Commission rejected rate design features where there was \nno evidence in the record showing that the rate design features reflected \ncost incurrence, id. In its order setting this proceeding for hearing, the \nCommission took note of Edison's proposed seasonal differential and \nspecifically directed that the parties fully address the issues related to \nthe cost support for the seasonal rate design, Commission Order issued March \n30, 1979, mimeo at 4-5. On October 9, 1980, the parties were directed by the \nPresiding Judge to identify in their initial briefs the portions of the \nrecord that relate to cost support for the seasonal differential.\n\nThe requirement that Edison provide cost support for its seasonal \ndifferential, as discussed supra, is also set forth in the Commission's \nfiling requirements for rate schedules: if the rate design is intended to \nreflect costs, the applicant must show how it reflects costs; if the rate \ndesign is not intended to reflect costs, the applicant must justify the \ndeparture from costbased rates, 18 CFR o35.13(b)(4)(iii) Statement P. \nEdison's seasonal differential is intended to lessen the costs imposed upon \nit by its prominent summer peak. Edison reasons that, since it must build \ncapacity to meet its prominent summer peak, charging more in the summer would \ngive customers an incentive to control their summer demands and, therefore, \nEdison's cost of adding capacity would be reduced (Tr. 169). Accordingly, \nEdison must show how its seasonal differential reflects the costs imposed on \nit by summer demand, under the Commission's filing requirements in 18 CFR o35.\n13(b)(4)(iii) Statement P. Further, even PURPA Section 111(d)(4) relied upon \nby Edison states that rates \"shall be on a seasonal basis which reflects the \ncosts of providing service to such class of consumers at different seasons of \nthe year to the extent that such costs vary seasonally for such utility.\" \n(Emphasis added.)\n\nFurther, support for relying on marginal rather than average costs comes from \nthe Commission itself. In its order of March 30, 1979 setting this cause for \nhearing, mimeo at 4, 5, the Commission, in commenting on time of day and \nseasonal rates, mentioned that it encourage innovative rate design to match \nmore closely rates to costs. In this regard, the Commission cited its Order \nNo. 537, supra at 4, which specifically suggests use of pricing mechanisms \nbased on marginal cost principles\n\n[65,236]\n\nfor jurisdictional wholesale sales. Under the circumstances in this case, \nwhere the sale of economy energy is related to Edison's costs in adding or \neliminating additional excess capacity, it is appropriate to establish the \nprice for economy transactions on marginal costs. This provides a more close \nmatching of the rate to the cost than would a rate design based on average \ncosts. Accordingly, Winnetka's position on pricing of economy energy will not \nbe adopted.\n\n AFFIRMED and REVERSED - see next paragraph\n\nCOMM-OPINION-ORDER, 23 FERC ?61,219, Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket Nos. \nER79-182-000 and ER80-106-000, (May 12, 1983)\nTurning to Commonwealth's exceptions, we find that the judge correctly \nrejected the seasonal differential. Even if we accept the company's \ninterpretation of PURPA, it still has not cited any record evidence \nwhatsoever of a difference in costs between summer and nonsummer months. \nWithout at least some showing of a cost difference, it is impossible to make \na judgment on the reasonableness of the company's 15.25% proposal. We \ntherefore uphold the judge on this point.\n\nWe reverse the judge's adoption of a price set at 110% of the utility's \nincremental costs, however, and approve the type-B split-savings method \nproposed by Commonwealth. Under this method, economy transactions are \narranged for a 12-hour or similar period at a fixed price based on cost \nestimates at the time of the agreement. If the utility's incremental costs \nrise to the point that continued supply would become burdensome, the utility \nmay terminate supply. We find this method superior to that proposed by staff \nin that implementation is greatly simplified. Cost determinations need not be \nmade as frequently.\n\nRelated to PMAs\n\nREG-PREAMBLE, FERCSR ?36,710, Procedures for Public Participation in Power \nand Transmission Rate Adjustments and Extensions, December 31, 1980, 10 CFR \n903, 45 FR 86976\n[36,741]\n\nHistorically, many PURPA-type standards have been used in designing wholesale \nrates for the sale of Federal hydroelectric power. PMAs analyze costs to \nestablish revenue requirements and consider this information in designing \nrates. Declining block rates for energy were once used by the PMAs but \nsubsequently were found inappropriate and eliminated from rate schedules. \nMany of the PMAs for years have been effectively using various forms of load \nmanagement measures in their rate schedules, such as scheduling limitations, \nloadshaping, capacity and energy overrun charges, etc. BPA has had a history \nof using seasonal rates for wholesale firm capacity and energy and also \noffered its direct service industrial customers interruptible rates some time \nago. Southwestern has had interruptible capacity rates in effect since 1957. \nThese examples demonstrate the willingness of the PMAs to implement \nPURPA-type standards where applicable.\n\nMany of these PURPA-type standards, when applied appropriately in the design \nof PMA rates, can serve to implement the purposes of PURPA by encouraging \nconservation of energy, efficient use of resources and facilities, and \nequitable rates. The public participation process will provide an opportunity \nto examine these and other appropriate concepts.\n\nThe PMAs will continue to review and revise their power marketing practices \non a system-by-system basis to serve the PURPA objectives. The Assistant \nSecretary for Resource Applications, working with the Administrators of the \npower administrations, and after receiving public comment, will consider the \nadoption of rate design guidelines, similar in form to the guidelines in RA \n6120.2 on financial accounting and ratemaking, which will reflect the \nexperience gained by the PMAs in their system-by-system approach to rate \ndesign.\n\n\nRelated to PURPA\n\nFED-LAW, FERCSR ?5021, PURPA, SEC. 111. CONSIDERATION AND DETERMINATION \nRESPECTING CERTAIN RATEMAKING STANDARDS.\n\n (4) Seasonal rates.--The rates charged by an electric utility for providing \nelectric service to each class of electric consumers shall be on a seasonal \nbasis which reflects the costs of providing service to such class of \nconsumers at different seasons of the year to the extent that such costs vary \nseasonally for such utility.\n\nFED-REG-NOTICE, FERCSR ?37,503, DOE Responsibilities Under Title I of PURPA\n\n(4) Seasonal rates shall be established where costs vary by season;\n\nPROP-REG-PREAMBLE, FERCSR 1988-1998 ?32,457, Administrative Determination of \nFull Avoided Costs, Sales of Power to Qualifying Facilities, and \nInter-connection Facilities, March 16, 1988, Docket No. RM88-6-000, 53 FR \n9331, 55 FR 31882\n\nPricing flexibility may take several different forms. For instance, a \ncontract could provide QFs with a price floor applicable to all the power \nsupplied to the utility, but still provide for higher variable unit prices \nreflecting daily or seasonal periods. The price floor would provide the \nrevenue stream necessary for the QF to secure financial support while\n\n[32,174]\n \nthe price variability would induce the QF to maximize deliveries in peak-load \nperiods when the utility values additional supplies most. Of course, the \nprice floor should not exceed the minimum value of the utility's avoided \ncost. Similarly, a contract could provide for a two part price--a fixed \npayment for capacity and an energy price for power delivered. The QF would be \nassured a minimum revenue stream based on the value of its capacity. The \nvariable energy component would allow the utility to dispatch the QF capacity \nonly when it was economic. Whatever the pattern of contract payments, rates \nfor purchases from QFs should always reflect how well the characteristics of \nthe suppliers' power match the purchasing utility's need. This will ensure \nthat the QF will make most production decisions on the basis of rates \nreflecting avoided costs (rather than the guaranteed average rate) and, at \nthe same time, will receive revenues sufficient to attract investors.\n\nTo avoid problems such as those associated with take-or-pay contracts in the \nnatural gas industry, the Commission wishes to stress the danger of including \nforecasted fuel costs in the fixed rate structure of long-term contracts, \nespecially in combination with the specification of minimum purchase \nquantities. The Commission also encourages the use of time-of-day and \nseasonal rates in flexible pricing structures for long-term contracts.\n\n\nREG-PREAMBLE, FERCSR 1977-1981 ?30,128, Small Power Production and \nCogeneration Facilities; Regulations Implementing Section 210 of the Public \nUtility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, Order No. 69, February 25, 1980, \nDocket No. RM79-55, 18 CFR 292, 45 FR 12214, 45 FR ...\n\nRather than specifying that exact time-of-day or seasonal rates for purchases \nare required, however, the Commission believes that the selection of a \nmethodology is best left to the State regulatory authorities and nonregulated \nelectric utilities charged with the implementation of these provisions.\n \n"

Our prior draft contained exceptions to the prohibitions to the\nprohibition on discriminatory treatment, regarding protection of native load\nto protect system reliability and to preserve a utility's ability to comply\nwith state-imposed obligations to serve.  I believe these concepts,\nparticularly the second, is inconsistent with our new approach, but  before\ndeleting these, wanted to make sure that there is not a political reason\nthat we should leave them in.

The document does \nnot fully address all of the issues discussed at last Thursday's congestion \nreform meeting in Sacramento, but I believe that (other than for some \ndetails) it is consistent with what both the ISO and many of the market \nparticipants are proposing.\n\nThis summary does not necessarily reflect the views of my clients, who \nhaven't yet had the time to review it... but I don't believe that it would be \ntoo far off.  \n\nI am sending this summary to you to put into context the many comments that I \noffered at last Thursday's meeting and also to support my view that, if the \nISO were to implement the CONG/ASM integration by DECENTRALIZING the process \nrather than CENTRALIZING the process, there would not be much difference \nbetween what I've been advocating in the Southwest and the CAISO's model.  \n(The primary remaining differences would be: (i) the way the \"hour-ahead\" \nprocess works - i.e., continuously vs. one discrete time; and (ii) the way \nscheduling is done - i.e., the ISO would not act as the SC's representative \nin acquiring rights that could be made available through inter-zonal \ncounterflows since the SCs would do this themselves.)  So there is a real \npossibility that, with some agreement on the ISO's longer-term plans (whether \nintegration of transmission rights and ancillary services procurement will \nrely on decentralization vs. centralization), we could bring together the \nmodels for the region.  \n\nCarl\n\n[Sue, Curt, Jim, Gary, Alex, Kent, Steven, John and Barney: I'd appreciate \nany feedback... but if you want me to see it, be sure to send it to \ncfi1@tca-us.com, NOT the enron address from which this e-mail was sent.   \nCarl]\n\n"

Southern has already left the \ncoalition.  We and others have put a full court press on to Reliant (the \nsource of the problem is John Stout in Houston).  The word is that Reliant \nwill also leave -- we're hoping for a big splash saying both Southern and \nReliant have left.\n\nThe other confusing issue is --why Sempra/San Diego G&E?  Terry Winter, ISO \nCEO and former officer at SDG&E, says that Sempra thinks nodalism is the only \nway to get prices high enough in San Diego to encourage construction of more \npower plants.  More power plants, more gas sales.  \n\nThe first item is a matrix from mid-April laying out all the positions at the \ntime.  The RC has now introduced a slightly new proposal called \"voluntary\" \n-- the concept being that you may opt for nodal or zonal on a month-by-month \nbasis.  This had not much support at the meeting at the ISO on May 10 and 11 \n-- especially since you end up with nodalism anyway.\n\nThe next item is a VERY LONG (45 pps) ISO doc -- the ISO proposal is called \nzonal forward -- from late April.\n\nI also included APX's \"flowgate\" model, which has some intriquing \ncharacteristics and which we can support with some slight modifications (it's \nvery close to what we have proposed, and may be easier to use in a world with \nmore parallel flows than we have today)\n\nIf you want more, more, MORE -- go to the ISO web site (caiso.com) then to \nClient Services, then to congestion reform, to see all the gory detail.\n\n    "

For example, under \nTW's tariff (which they concede is GISB compliant), primary firm cannot bump \nalt. firm in cycle 2.  SoCal says this means that any primary shipper \nattempting to deliever to an in-path alt. point will be unable to re-nominate \nto its primary point once this \"alternate\" capacity [I assume they mean \nUSGT's] is confirmed.  According to SoCal this will substantially limit \nshippers' flexibility, including the ability to use market area pooling.  \nOnce gas is nominated thru a pool its subsequent movement to a delivery point \nis defined as an al. delivery regardless of the rights of the capacity under \nwhich it moves.  Thus by manipulating the GISB cycle process, TW and USGT \nwill bump firm shippers.\n\nI could really use your help in responding to this argument.

          "body": "I reviewed the ECAR filing.  ECAR is requiring Enron to agree to use it as an \nECAR control area.  I generally think it is a good filing and of importance \nbecause it is one of the first times that any reliability requirement of a \nregion has been filed at FERC (ECAR asks FERC to balance commercial needs, \nreliability, equity, legal and policy objectives).  The compensation between \nECAR control areas is meant to discourage Cinergy-type stealing from the \ngrid.  It is mandatory for ECAR and ECAR invites other regions to \nparticipate.  \n\nInadvertant interchange (II) will be calculated over one hour.  The NERC \nperformance subcomm. will balance the II to establish long and short \nparties.  Based on a proportional allocation, the short party will pay the \nlong party its top incremental cost (highest purchase price or generation \nprice for power) + 10% penalty.  A $15/MW offset is used as the price of \npower repaid in kind to the interconnected system based on existing NERC \nsettlement procedures.  Price information is confidential.\n\nThe ECAR dispute resolution procedure is applicable (binding ADR is \nvoluntary).  Parties retain the right to go directly to FERC.\n\nLloyd -- Are you OK with the specifics?\n\nI do not see any reason to protest this.  EPSA wants to use the $15 offset to \nshow what may be reasonable for generator interconnects and I am discussing \nit with EPSA.  We should file a routine intervention (to obtain pleadings, \norders, etc.)  Interventions are due Friday, May 5.  \n\nAnyone disagree?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDave Mangskau@ENRON\n04/20/2000 04:58 PM\nTo: Christi L Nicolay/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Charles Yeung/HOU/ECT@ECT, Greg Woulfe/HOU/ECT@ECT, Patrick \nHanse/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bill Rust/HOU/ECT@ECT, Lloyd Will/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard \nIngersoll/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON \nSubject: Re: ECAR filing  \n\nChristi:\nfor your info if you plan to file in support of this ECAR action, as Enron's \nrep to ECAR  I discussed this internally and have been supportive of a final \nproduct that includes sanctions.  Enron is not a voting member nor were we \ngiven an opportunity to make changes to the final document that went out for \nballot..........but it was similar to what was discussed in recent ECAR \nmeetings and was finalized after ECAR reps met with FERC staff to meet FERC \nconcerns.  \n\nIn addition, several weeks ago I presented the ECAR concept to the MAPP \nExecutive Committee and after discussion MAPP passed a resolution of support \nfor what ECAR was trying to accomplish to improve reliability.   In order to \nmake a payment sanction for inadvertent really work, it should be approved by \nan entire interconnection.  ECAR officials are expecting approval very \nquickly so that sanctions are in place this summer to help support \nreliability.\n\nIf Enron has changed its position, and we plan to oppose this action, lets \ndiscuss the ramifications including putting at risk the expected Executive \nBoard action on May 1 to ratify CRC and OP & L recommendations to grant \nconditional certification of our two control areas in \nECAR.                    thanx      \n\n\n   \n\t\n\t\n\tFrom:  Christi L Nicolay @ ECT                           04/20/2000 11:17 AM\n\t\n\nTo: Charles Yeung/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dave Mangskau/Corp/Enron@Enron, Greg \nWoulfe/HOU/ECT@ECT, Patrick Hanse/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bill Rust/HOU/ECT@ECT, Lloyd \nWill/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard Ingersoll/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@Enron, Charles Yeung/HOU/ECT@ECT \n\nSubject: ECAR filing\n\nECAR actually filed this at FERC already this week.

While the unconstricted nature of the secondary market\nwill facilitate more and new entrants in the capacity market, this fluid \nquality\nnevertheless creates a risk of concentration, insofar as capacity that was\nawarded in the initial Open Season may be assigned to any creditworthy market\nparticipant and without market share limits.  Indeed, the Comprehensive\nSettlement does not provide for a mandatory electronic bulletin board for\nsecondary market trades and, accordingly, tracking secondary market trades \nwould\nbe complicated and administratively infeasible.  Nonetheless, the Commission\nshould remain cognizant of the risk of market concentration and commit to\nrespond to any such complaints raised by market participants.\"\n\nWith all due respect, it is a rather transparent attempt to get the Commission\nto focus on on the secondary market issue. We agreed to exclude secondary \nmarket\nacquisitions as a measure of market concentration. The above paragraph signals\nthe Commission that this is a problem and dilutes the value of the testimony.\n"

My recommendation is that \nwe play it safe and assume we will need to file testimony on April 17.  To \nthat end, it's time to review some basics.\n\nIn its July 8, 1999 decision, the Commission stated:  \"We see reason to \npursue a change in protocol for receiving gas at Hector Road, even in the \nshort term.  If there are burdens that would unfairly fall upon Transwestern \ncustomers is a window was established at Hector Road, we want to hear about \nit in the next phase of the proceeding.  In addition, we seek specific \nproposals as to how such an arrangement should be defined.\"\n\nAccordingly, the testimony we file should explain:\n\n1.  The unfair harm that could potentially befall TW customers if Hector Road \nwere established as a formal receipt point\n2.   Our proposal for making Hector a formal receipt point by establishing \nprimary and secondary receipt points\n3.  Why our proposal is fair and consistent with Commission policy (here we \nmight want to draw analogies to the interstate system and explain why that \nworks)\n\nI will also have an opportunity to make legal and policy arguments in a brief \nafter testimony has been filed.\n\nLet's discuss how best to go about drafting the testimony.  I think the best \nthing to do would be to outline the testimony, then decide who is going to \nsay what.  I'm available after about 2:00 today.\n "

There have been several recent developments in \npower and gas, as discussed in the attached memo.  It would be helpful for \nMartin to discuss these recent orders as necessary in order to attempt to \ngain support from Dick O'Neill for the idea of lifting the cap for power.  \nAfter Martin's discussion, we should consider reapproaching FERC to seek \napproval.

          "body": "With regard to the Commission's limitations on the right of first refusal, \nOrder 637 provides for grandfathering of discounted long-term contracts that \nare now subject to ROFR.  The Commission's rationale was that grandfathering \ngives all shippers notice of the new limitation and the opportunity to \nre-execute current contracts.  The TW Commercial Group has asked whether we \nshould challenge the grandfathering of existing contracts.  In limiting the \nright of first refusal, the Commission has expressly acknowledged that if a \ncustomer is truly captive and has no alternatives for service, it is likely \nthat its contract will be at the maximum rate.  Shippers that are not captive \nand have alternatives in the marketplace do not need the protection of ROFR, \nand the pipeline should be able to negotiate with other interested shippers \nupon expiration of the contract. \n \nIn light of these conclusions, there should be no reason to grandfather the \nROFR rights of shippers under existing discounted contracts.  Such shippers \nwould not be harmed by removal of the right immediately upon the effective \ndate of a pipeline's tariff filing to limit the right of first refusal \n(assuming the service contract incorporates tariff terms on an \"as amended\" \nbasis).  Consistent with the Commission's order, it would not be unfair to \nmake these shippers compete with others for the capacity upon expiration of \nthe contract.  "

          "body": "The CPUC is very aware that the utilities have gone to the legislature when \nthe UDCs face elimination of some of the advantages that they have in the \nretail market.  We now have a fully-constituted commission (5 members) with \ntwo new democratic appointees with close ties to the governor.  This may \nempower the CPUC to take control of issues within their purvue, which \nratemaking and the PX credit, clearly are.  Some members of the legislature \nare loathe to get into the CPUC's backyard and \"micro-manage\".  That being \nsaid, we still face significant risk within the legislature.  We have Steve \nPeace, who thinks a wholesale pass-through is adequate for competition, and \nRod Wright, the chair of the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee, who \nsponsored a similar bill last year and who doesn't believe in retail \ncompetition either.  We have our work cut out for us.\n\nLast year we fought essentially the same battle and defeated the utilities at \nattempts to include similar provisions into law for electricity.  We were \nable to do so because we had a broad coalition of supporters, including the \nenvironmental community.  Essentially, everyone opposed the utilities' \nproposals.\n\nThis year we have a different scenario.  SCE is attempting to peel off \nenvironmental groups by rolling in extension of the public purpose funding.  \nThey are also talking to the large consumers, who may perceive that they are \nable to get a better deal from the utilities by avoiding the mark-up.\n\nHowever, it doesn't appear as though the utilities are united in supporting \nSCE's language.  We are actively attempting to revive the coalition that was \nso effective last year.  We are talking to the environmental groups to try \nand keep them in the fold.  This can be done by keeping the two issues of \npublic purpose funding and competition as separate as possible.  \n\nWe have been encouraged to settle the PX credit case by the judge.  We are \nengaged in the beginning stages of settlement on the PX credit issue with \nSDG&E.  We are a long way from settling, however, if we are successful, the \nsettlement would likely be precedential for both SCE and PG&E.  There is \nsignificant room between the utility proposals for the \"retail\" portion of \nthe PX credit and what we are supporting.  We also appear to have the support \nof the ratepayer advocates.  We are attempting to get the customer groups to \nagree on an outcome, leaving the utilities isolated.  Adoption of our \nproposal for the full retail adder is a long-shot.\n\nFrom a timing perspective, it is possible that we will resolve this issue at \nthe PUC, before any legislation would become effective.  However, that would \nnot prevent the legislation from estopping the CPUC decision.\n\nWe could use the help of the business units in providing documented \ninformation about the UDCs activities, if its available.

This language has not yet found a \nbill. However, in order to be prepared, Sandi McCubbin has asked me to \nforward the proposed  language for analysis. \n\nBellow is a preliminary analysis of the bill and of our position. Please \nexpand, edit and complete for legislative action. Please foward to \nappropreate people for comments.\n\nSummary:\n\nSCE is defining the basic electric service to include, Distribution, \nMetering, Billing, and Customer Service\n\nSCE believes that the UDC should be the default provider and offer commodity \nat a pass through PX price with no adders.\n\nEvery customer will be charged a non-bypassable charge for basic electric \nservice (customer charge) and a non-bypassable public goods charge (Energy \nefficiency, low income, R&D, and renewable charge). Renewable charge includes \nfunding for production credits for renewable not under contract with utility, \nmandatory state purchase of renewable energy, minimum utility content of \nrenewable energy, PX green product, Customer credit for Renewables not under \ncontract with the utility.\n\nDA customers can choose billing and metering services from their ESP and will \nreceive an avoided cost credit from the UDC for these services.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nSCE is trying to preempt through the legislation the role of the utility to \nbe a Wires and Revenue Cycle Services (RCS) company. Furthermore they see \nthemselves as being a default provider and offer electric commodity at the \nwholesale price, undermining any kind of competition from ESPs.\n\nTheir definition of what is included in the renewable credit again undermines \nany competition for ESPs in offering these products.\n\nFurthermore, although SCE allows ESPs to offer metering and billing services, \nthe credit ESPs can receive is based on an avoided cost. The CPUC is \ncurrently presiding over a proceeding, in which it is trying to unbundle RCS. \nAt a minimum the credits for billing and metering services should be based on \nLong Run Marginal Costs.\n\nPosition: Actively Oppose\n\nThe UDC should be a wires only company. For a UDC, Basic Electric Service \nshould only include the distribution of the electric power and should be \nrenamed as Basic Electric Distribution Service. Revenue Cycle Services \n(metering, billing,..) should be unbundled from the distribution function. \nCosts allocated to these functions should be based, at a minimum, on a Long \nRun Marginal Costs or Embedded Costs. The Avoided Costs allocation does not \nrepresent all the costs associated with these services. \n\nThe default provider function should be competitively bid out to ESPs and \nnon-regulated affiliates. The UDCs should be out of the energy service \nbusiness including all electric retail functions. The commodity charge for \ndefault customers should include the PX price, all procurement related costs, \nand retail marketing related costs. \n   \nCurrently, the green market is the only viable market in CA for small \nconsumers.  This proposal would eliminate the competitive market and ensure \nmarket-share dominance for UDC and PX. \n\nSCE's proposal would limit, or seriously restrict, the development of the \nmarket to only UDC-provided green products of PX-provided green products.  \nThis structure creates a subsidy for both the UDCs and the PX for green \nproducts, which would disadvantage competitive offerings for the amount under \ncontract, providing the UDC with a guaranteed base-load of green-product \ndemand.  The market available to competitors for green would be only the \ndemand in excess of the base, for which customers (not ESPs) would receive a \ncredit from the UDC for the incremental green demand.  Again, because the UDC \nwould be in the position of doling out credits for green, they would still \ncontrol that market.\n\nAttached is a copy of SCE's draft language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

The reporting \nwill include affiliations and conditions of service.  This is a procedural \nrule - reporting only.  The rule only applies to gas pipelines - FERC found \ntransportation for oil pipelines to be just and reasonable.  The Commission \nis acting in part as a response to the ruling in Sea Robin in which the court \ndirected FERC to reconsider the manner in which it applied its primary \nfunction test to Sea Robin's predominantly offshore system.  \n\nNOPR was issued on June 30, 1999.  The Commission believes that the new OCSLA \nreporting requirements mirror certain existing NGA reporting requirements.  \nSalient points of the final rule are:\n\nExemptions\nService providers that confine their operations to moving their own gas or \nthat of a single shipper are exempt from reporting; add new section \n330.0(a)(1) and (2)   Note:  reporting exemption turns on identity of service \nprovider and its shippers - not type of service provided.\nGas service providers that are regulated by FERC under NGA are exempt from \nOCSLA reporting; add new section (330.3(a)(4)\nExempts lines that feed into a facility where gas is first collected, \nseparated, dehydrated or processed from OCSLA reporting requirements; add new \nsection 330.3(a)(3).\n\nReporting Requirements\nIf an NGA-regulated company's system includes OCS facilities that are not \nsubject to NGA (gathering/production lines), the company must submit an OCSLA \nreport covering its non-NGA facilities\nReclassified facilities will no longer be subject to NGA reporting \nrequirements but will be subject to OCSLA requirements. (Shippers  no longer \nhave protection against the exercise of market power afforded by the NGA). \nService provider must list all of its affiliates defined as engaged in the \nexploration, development, production, processing, transportation, marketing, \nconsumption or sale of gas need be identified in the report; new section \n330.2(a)(6)\nReporting Updates restricted to four times per year.  \nReports will be based on conditions on the first day of the first full \ncalendar quarter that begins after the effective date of this rule; reports \ndue on the first business day after the close of the quarter.  Providers will \nhave more than one full quarter in which to prepare their initial OSCLA report\nProviders will be required to submit a description of their operations as \nthey stand on the first day of each calendar quarter, e.g. describing the \nprovider's status on one particular day; report due on first business day of \nthe subsequent quarter (e.g. filing due April 1 will describe operations as \nthey stood on January 1).  If the operations are identical on the first and \nlast days of any given quarter, provider need not submit an update the \nfollowing quarter\nNot necessary to file contracts but must provide table of shippers and \nservices; new section 330.2(b)\nRetaining requirement for alternative reporting for OCS companies who do not \nprovide service under formal contracts, must provide information sufficient \nto derive rates charged and conditions applicable for service between two \npoints; new section 330.2(b)(9)\nOCSLA Reporting Form available via Internet  http://www.ferc.fed.us or the \npublic reference room\nProviders new to provisions have 90 days to prepare and submit OCSLA report \n(NOPR had stipulated 60 days)."

          "body": "On 3/30/98, Aquila filed a complaint at FERC against Entergy that Entergy \nreserved all of the firm import capacity (2000 MW) at four key interfaces, \neven though Entergy did not designate any off-system network resources to \ncover these reservations.  Aquila's transmission requests were denied or \ncurtailed causing it to suffer financial losses.  Entergy responded that \nAquila had a \"fundamental misunderstanding\" of Order No. 888 et seq. and that \na transmission provider may deny tariff requests, if that transmission \nprovider's own reservations \"are based on the legitimate reliability needs\" \nof its bundled retail customers.\n\nReservation facts:  Entergy posted on its OASIS site that it reserved 2000 MW \nof capacity at its interfaces with TVA (1100 MW), Southern (400 MW), Arkansas \nElectric Coop (250 MW), and Union Electric (250 MW) under the label \"Firm \nImport for Native Load.\"  Entergy did not designate network resources in the \nsame manner that it required from Aquila and other network customers.  \nEntergy explained that its reservations were needed \"to meet the immediate \nreliability needs of the Entergy System and to accommodate native load growth \nover the next few years.\"  (Entergy later told FERC that this was needed for \n\"current loads\" only--not future growth.)\n\nEntergy argued to FERC that it is able to satisfy its generation reserve \nrequirements, while maintaining lower amounts of generating capacity within \nits control area, only because it can rely on the 2000 MWs at issue to reach \nneighboring control areas, therefore this is \"a legitimate reliability \nneed.\"  Entergy then claimed that Sec. 28.2 of the pro forma tariff (that \nrequires a transmission provider, on behalf of its Native Load Customers, to \ndesignate its network resources in the same manner as any Network Customer) \ndoes not apply to a utility's uses of its transmission system to serve \nbundled retail customers. \n\nIn a draft order issued today, FERC disagreed with Entergy and found that \nEntergy reserved virtually all of the firm capacity on four key interfaces, \neven though it had no off-system network resources.  Instead, Entergy used \nits firm transmission reservation to purchase power whenever it was \neconomical.  Entergy denied all other firm transmission requests and \nentertained non-firm transmission requests only when it was unable to make an \neconomic deal for itself.  Even though Entergy is not required to take \ntransmission under its tariff for retail load, it is required to designate \nnetwork resources and loads.  The off-system resource must be generation \nowned by the transmission provider or under contract.  \n\nAlthough FERC found that Entergy violated the OATT and normally the \ntransmission should be released, Entergy has now begun to designate network \nresources (these new procedures are pending at FERC).  Aquila also asked FERC \nfor its financial losses of $281,000, but FERC said it lacked authority to \norder money damages.  FERC would order refunds of the transmission rate, but \nAquila did not allege that it paid for services it did not receive.\n\nInterestingly, FERC told Aquila that it could bring this matter up in Entergy \nPower Marketing's currently pending 3 year update of its market-based rates \nstating that  use of the transmission system on a non-preferential basis is a \nfundamental condition for market-based rates.  (Entergy argued against this \nsaying that there was no allegation that it had profited.  FERC rejected this \nargument.)  Dynegy has already protested Entergy's 3 year update stating that \nEntergy is exercising market power by limiting new generation through poor \ninterconnection procedures and agreements.  Enron filed one sentence support \nof Dynegy's protest.  I think this is why Entergy recently filed its \ninterconnection agreement and procedures at FERC.\n\nComm. Herbert dissented saying that this was a \"technically\" from several \nyears ago.\n\nWatch for this type of activity from other providers."

          "body": "EPMI won a moral as well as financial victory today in the continuing MAPP \nrefund proceeding.  In response to EPMI's protest of MAPP's refund report, \nFERC issued an order rejecting MAPP's report, finding that MAPP erred in \nfailing to make total refunds to EPMI and others.  As you may recall, in \nresponse to the complaint filed by EPMI in 1997, FERC issued an order in \nApril, 1999, finding that MAPP had overcharged EPMI and other transmission \ncustomers for transmission service.  FERC ordered MAPP to make refunds to \nEPMI and the other transmission customers.  \n\nIn order to make refund payments to customers, MAPP sought payment from its \ntransmission owning members.  One transmission owning member, Nebraska Public \nPower District (NPPD), refused to pay MAPP, arguing that it is a \nnon-jurisidictional entity and should not have to pay FERC-ordered refunds.  \nBecause NPPD refused to pay MAPP, MAPP refused to refund to transmission \ncustomers those amounts assessed against NPPD.  When MAPP filed its refund \nreport with FERC (as required by FERC in the April order), MAPP stated that \nit was not refunding those amounts owed by NPPD.  EPMI protested MAPP's \nreport, arguing that MAPP is responsible for paying the full amount of \nrefunds, regardless of its dispute with NPPD.\n\nIn its order issued today, FERC rejects MAPP's filing, stating that \"[w]e \nagree with Enron.\"  (This may be the first time FERC has ever uttered that \nphrase.)  FERC states that Enron and the other customers are entitled to the \nfull amount of refunds, and MAPP cannot use its dispute with NPPD to escape \nits obligation to pay full refunds.  While FERC does not address the issue of \nwhether MAPP is a public utility itself (an argument we made in our protest), \nFERC does state that it has the authority to order MAPP's jurisdictional \npublic utility members (through MAPP) to pay the full amount of refunds owed. \n FERC directs MAPP to refund the full amounts owed and to submit a revised \nrefund report."

          "body": " May 17, 2000\n\n\nVia Internet\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTO: Interested Clients\n\nFROM: John & Hengerer\n\nRE: Commission Meeting -- May 17, 2000\n\nAt today's meeting, the Commissioners approved the consent agenda and then \ndiscussed the following items.  \n\n ELECTRIC MATTERS\nAlliance Companies, et al., Docket Nos. ER99-3144\nIn December 1999, the Commission issued an order conditionally authorizing \nthe formation of the Alliance RTO.  At today's meeting, the Commissioners \ndenied (by a margin of 3 to 1, Commissioner Hebert dissenting) rehearing of \nthe December 1999 order.  The Commissioners also unanimously rejected \n(Commissioner Massey concurring) Alliance's compliance filing.\n\nIn its original filing, Alliance proposed allowing each of its 5 active \nowners to retain up to a 5 percent ownership interest in the RTO (up to 25 \npercent total ownership by active owners).  The December 1999 order rejected \nthis proposal as contrary to the independence principle outlined in Order No. \n2000, which states that active ownership should be limited to a total of 15 \npercent unless special circumstances are shown.  Rejecting requests for \nrehearing, the majority concluded that Alliance had failed to justify active \nmember ownership in excess of 15 percent.  Dissenting, Commissioner Hebert \nargued that (i) the 15 percent benchmark is arbitrary and should not be \nviewed as creating a binding legal requirement. and (ii) limiting active \nownership will provide a disincentive for other utilities to join the RTO.\n\n\n3\n\nThe Commissioners also rejected Alliance's compliance filing submitted to \nsatisfy the terms of the December 1999 order.  In addition to failing to \ncorrect the active ownership issue outlined above, the Commissioners faulted \nAlliance for not eliminating pancaked rates and for not addressing issues \nassociated with the RTO's scope and configuration.  Commissioner Massey \nindicated that he would write a concurrence to stress that Aseams@ agreements \ndo not negate the need to review the RTO's scope and configuration to ensure \nthat it is properly designed and sized. \n\nSouthwest Power Pool, Docket No. EL00-39\nThe Commissioners unanimously rejected, as failing to meet the requirements \nof Order No. 2000, the Southwest Power Pool's (SPP) RTO proposal.  \nCommissioner Massey, who moved the item to the discussion agenda, cited the \nfollowing shortcomings in SPP's proposal: (i) operational control of \ntransmission facilities was not turned over to the RTO; (ii) the RTO's \nproposed open-access transmission tariff did not comply with Order No. 2000; \n(iii) no real-time balancing market had been proposed; (iv) lingering \nconcerns with the RTO's governance structure; and (v) the RTO's proposed \nscope and configuration are inadequate.  Commissioner Massey encouraged the \nSPP to join other entities seeking to form an RTO, or consider merging with \nthe Midwest ISO. \n\nNotice of Interim Procedures to Support Reliability and Request for Comments, \nDocket No. EL00-75\nThe Commissioners unanimously approved short-term procedures designed to \naddress Summer 2000 reliability concerns.  The approved measures provide for \n(i) streamlining FERC procedures to promote on-site, distributed generation, \n(ii) waiving prior-notice requirements for load-reduction agreements, (iii) \nimproving demand-side price signals, (iv) requiring more extensive OASIS \nposting of available transmission capacity; and (v) making Commission Staff \nmore available to the industry to address reliability concerns.  Comments on \nthe proposed short-term measures are due by June 2, 2000.  \n\nAdditionally, agreeing that the short-term procedures are very minimal in \nnature, the Commissioners requested comments on long-term reliability \nissues.  Comments are due by June 30, 2000.\nFinally, Commissioner Hebert indicated that he would write a separate \nconcurrence to express his belief that competitive forces are the answer to \nreliability concerns and to criticize the Commission for not eliminating \nartificial price caps and promoting competitive rates.  Commissioner Hebert's \naccusation that the Commission was more concerned with politics than good \npolicy touched off a heated debate, with Chairman Hoecker reciting FERC \nsuccesses and Commissioner Massey scoffing at Commissioner Hebert's \nsuggestion that price caps were to blame for generation shortages. \n\n\n\n GAS MATTERS\nRegulation of Short-Term Natural Gas Transportation Services, Regulation of \nInterstate Natural Gas Transportation Services, Docket Nos. RM98-10, RM98-12\nThe Commissioners unanimously addressed and generally denied requests for \nrehearing of Order No. 637.  Finding that Order No. 637 strikes a good \nbalance between competing interests, the Commissioners indicated that their \norder would, with several exceptions, uphold the mandates of the order.  The \nCommissioners expressly noted that requests for rehearing of \nright-of-first-refusal (ROFR) roll-up issues would be denied. Order No. 637 \nstates that, if a pipeline is fully subscribed, a party wishing to exercise a \nROFR will be required to match competing bids, even if a competing bid \nexceeds the maximum rate for the capacity.  \n\nRevisions and clarifications of Order No. 637 approved by the Commissioners \nat today's meeting include:\n(1) shippers with multi-year contracts at max rates for seasonal service will \nretain their ROFR;\n(2) pipelines will be required to post available capacity within one hour of \neach nomination cycle, rather than within one day as directed by Order 637;\n(3) short-term capacity release transactions must be posted within one hour \nof the first nomination under the contract, rather than upon the execution of \nthe contract as stated in Order No. 637; and\n(4) Order No. 637's OFO penalty and imbalance provisions will be clarified in \nthe Commission order.\n\nAlthough comments at today's meeting were brief, we anticipate a lengthy \norder addressing the numerous issues raised by parties in their requests for \nrehearing."

          "body": " When the Commission granted Texas Eastern authority to hold capacity on \nanother pipeline in Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation, 74 FERC P 61,074 \n(1996), it stated that when a pipeline holds capacity on an upstream \npipeline, the downstream pipeline's customers may hold title to the gas \ntransported on the upstream pipeline.  The Commission recognized this as one \nof the limited exceptions to the shipper must have title rule.  Specifically, \nthe Commission stated:  \n\nThe downstream pipeline will not hold title to gas shipped on capacity it has \nacquired on an upstream \npipeline. Rather, shippers on the downstream pipeline will hold title to the \ngas on the upstream \npipeline. We will allow a pipeline to hold the upstream capacity; we will \nnot, however, allow the pipeline \nto hold title to the gas being shipped.  Thus, the downstream pipeline will \nbe the shipper on the upstream \npipeline, but will not hold title when the gas is being shipped. This results \nin a limited exception to the rule \nthat a shipper must hold title to gas being shipped. \n\nI believe that if we can address the Commission's other concerns about this \nfiling, they will grant a similar waiver for this transaction.  You can feel \nfree to pass this along to your contact at PNM."

We have until Friday, April 28th, \n3:00p.m. EST to offer our legal technical changes.  If you can return your \ncomments to me (hand-written comments on the document itself are fine), I \nwill communicate them directly to the Senators' offices.    \n\nWE MUST KEEP THIS DOCUMENT COMPLETELY CONFIDENTIAL FOR OUR INTERNAL USE \nONLY.  WE SHOULD NOT COMMENT TO PRESS OR OTHERS THAT WE KNOW THE DOCUMENT \nEXISTS, NOR SHOULD WE DISCUSS THAT WE ASSISTED IN ITS WRITING.  THE POLITICS \nREQUIRE THIS COURSE OF ACTION.\n\nNext week, after the bill is introduced, I recommend we make public comment \nin support of the legislation as it continues to move the process forward \ntowards bill enactment this Congress.\n\nThe bill contains a date certain of 1/1/2002; stranded cost recovery \nlanguage; PURPA 210 repeal, the bundled FERC authority for interstate \ntransmission and reliability plus the non-discrimination language we \nsuccessfully lobbied for and about which Congressman Barton is already aware \nof Senator Gramm's support for Enron's position, PUHCA repeal, environmental \nconditionality and tax provisions for publics, coop's and nuclear \ndecommissioning.  Although we successfully drafted and communicated our \ntransmission language to the Senators, their attorneys have made language \nadjustments (pride of authorship) which our attorneys should confirm have not \ncaused material defect.  If so, we can suggest drafting changes by this \nFriday.\n\nAll the language you have has been agreed to by both Senators.  The section \nmissing, the environmental provision, is the last section the two men will \nwork out this week and will be essential to final bill passage.  Their goal \nremains addressing the grandfathered coal facilities and their disagreements \nare technical in nature.  Namely:  do you disqualify pre-1971 constructed \ncoal facilities at a percentage responsible for a percentage of emissions (a \nRepublican approach) or do you qualify facilities which can operate ( a \nregulatory approach favored by the Democrats)?  With the Bush/Gore \nPresidential race in full swing, this issue brings ramifications and politics \nto bear at the highest level.\n\nAs a further update on this issue:  tomorrow the Senate holds a hearing on \nthis issue with all four of the FERC Commissioners testifying, the \nMid-American group and the DOE Pro-Competition Stakeholder group are meeting \nwith each other to gain further consensus, plus both are meeting with NARUC's \nChuck Grey and Chris Mele to seek consensus.  I will attend all these \nmeetings for Enron and report back our continued progress.  Further, we are \nscheduling Dr. Tabors and Enron's Bob Schultz for a Congressional Hill \nbriefing next week to discuss Dr. Tabors' research on the price spike as \nproof Congress must make structural changes to the interstate rules plus \ndemonstrate Enron On-Line's ability to show market price inefficiency.  \nFinally, we will participate in a \"team drafting\" exercise with MidAmerican \non their compromise right of first refusal transmission language with Dan \nWatkiss as our representative, with others represented by Bill Sherman, Besty \nMoler and Randy Davis.  This is an effort to include the Bennett Johnston ACE \ngroup into the MidAmerican fold.  We did get MidAmerican to add the \nseparation of market and transmission function language in the context of the \nRTO language.\n\nMuch progress continues even though the House is not in session this week.  \nThe month of May will provide opportunities for Enron to continue \nintensifying our legislative efforts.  To date, the strategy we at Enron laid \nout months ago is playing out with the two tracks of consensus and \nreliability crisis both receiving traction.  We just need the dominoes we \nsuccessfully laid out the strategy for months ago to continue falling.\n\nPlease feel free to call me should you need additional information or have \nany questions.\n"

          "body": "TVA and Entergy filed answers to the numerous protests to Entergy's source \nand sink filing.\n\nTVA responded specifically to Enron and VEPCO's filings basically stating \nthat the NERC letter was limited to the TVA/Enron dispute and inapplicable to \nthe Entergy issue.  TVA also made accusations that Enron in effect secretly \ntalked with NERC to get a task force made up of members \"predisposed to \nEnron's point of view.\"  TVA said that the task force ignored TVA's requests \nto meet with it and that the task force went beyond current NERC policy.  \nFinally, TVA understands that \"Enron has prevented SERC\" from bringing the \nmatter to NERC ADR.\n\nEntergy's answer largely cites past FERC orders that approved the source and \nsink on tags (and denied Enron's Capacity Reservation Tariff) and basically \nstates that the protests are a collateral attack on Order No. 888 (as we have \nknown, the OATT does require ultimate source and sink on firm and allows them \non non-firm).  Entergy's filing, however, is lacking in substantive reasons \nwhy reliability would be so much better served by requiring this at the \nreservation level, when NERC has stated it is not necessary for reliability \nuntil the 20/30 minute ahead tag.  Entergy says it can do a better job of \nlisting actual ATCs and will prevent Entergy from overselling its system \n(although since Entergy's ATCs are usually low or 0 coming in over the ties, \nI question how many times Entergy has oversold Firm transmission.)  Entergy \nalso states that it and the Security Coordinators can police the IDC tags, in \ncase the marketer puts the wrong priority information on the tag (how often \ndoes this happen?).  [[I also don't know how Entergy is going to have time to \ncheck all this, when we called FERC hotline on them last year for lack of \ntimely responses to reservation and tags]].  Although the IDC does not even \nanalyze specific bus bars (and generator source and sink are optional on the \ntags now), Entergy says this is \"irrelevant\", but TLRs will be improved.\n\nEntergy cites FERC's 1998 OASIS orders that \"EPSA has not made a compelling \nargument that disclosure would harm liquidity.\"  I think that the compelling \narguments are being made now about the discrimination.  Although FERC \napproved the source and sink, transmission providers have not been using them \nand the tags don't require them.\n\nEntergy notes that when FERC issued the OASIS order, specific bus bar \ninformation was required on the tag -- now it is optional on the tag.  Even \nso, Entergy states that requiring it on the reservation does not make it \ninconsistent with the tag.  (I disagree.)\n\nFinally, Entergy says that we can always put in \"anticipated\" source and \nsink, but if it changes, our priority may change.  It is my understanding \nthat even the smallest change in source and sink will make some change in the \npower flows, so you effectively would always go to the lowest priority.\n\nWe are considering filing a response that states the lack of evidence on the \nreliability issues when NERC doesn't think this is required is a material \nissue of fact that should be set for hearing, at least.\n\n"

At the meeting\nyesterday, it became clear that the very generic language we have discussed\nwas not going to work for enough folks.  Cynthia Sandherr suggested an\nalternative approach that would be more detailed, but would track Order No.\n2000 as closely as possible.\n\nCynthia Stinger volunteered that Randy Davis had put much of the standards\nsection of Order 2000 in legislative language, but also added a number of\nissues that are not in 2000.  Obviously, some of these provisions (and\npossibly some that are in Order 2000) will be unacceptable to some in the\ngroup.  When you have an opportunity, please take a look at this and give me\nyour best objective judgment on what here is acceptable and what is not for\nyour organization.\n\nObviously, we would have to add at the beginning the language that was in\nthe original proposed draft language on RTOs re: 1) \"adopt rules requiring\nthe formation of regional transmission organizations and prescribing the\nminimum characteristics and functions of such organizations,\" and 2) \"order\na transmitting utility operating within a region to participate in a\nregional transmission organization to remedy undue discrimination or\nanti-competitive effects\" that is already agreed to.\n\nI will be leaving town at about 3:00 PM tomorrow, but would like to get\nideas on schedules for activity.  Please try to forward to me your first\nimpressions on the RTO language before then.  I will forward comments to\nBetsy and Brent Gale in my company to see if we can have a draft ready when\nI return on Thursday morning.\n\nI would like to hold another meeting of the group on Friday morning of next\nweek, or alternatively, we could meet over lunch on Friday.  Please let me\nknow of any preferences in that regard.\n\nSecond, I would like to hold a joint meeting with the other stakeholder\ngroup on Monday at 11:00.  I will confirm this next week.  The purpose of\nthe meeting will be to go over legislative drafts on market power and RTOs\n(hopefully they will be ready).\n\nTuesday, June 6th, I think we should devote the full day to lobbying Senate\noffices (Thursday and Friday of the previous week are possibilities also).\n\nThursday, June 8th, I will set up meetings with key House offices.\n\nI know everyone will not be able to do all of these, but as always if you\ncan do a meeting, it's a great help.\n\nPlease get back to me with comments on the RTO language as soon as possible.\n\nThanks,\n\nTom\n\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: cstinger@gpu.com [mailto:cstinger@gpu.com]\nSent: Thursday, May 25, 2000 1:35 PM\nTo: Bonner, Thomas D\nCc: jcohen@gpu.com; jloveng@gpu.com; rdavis@sdsatty.com\nSubject: Alliance Language\n\n\n\n\nTom,\n\nAttached is the ACE language on RTOs.\n\nCynthia\n\n\n\n(See attached file: Trans201.doc)\n\n\n - Trans201.doc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

(I don't know if you want to put the=\n=20\nvalues that Kevin is giving into the database). =20\n\n (1)  Completed the negotiations and FERC filing of the Next Hour Market=20\nscheduling proposal.  When implemented, scheduled for June 2000, this will=\n=20\nprovide one stop shopping for next hour business.  Ties OASIS and TAGGING=\n=20\ntogether into one request.  Also if a tranmission provider cuts the=20\ntransmission the PSE only pays for his actual use versus what he originally=\n=20\nscheduled. This will speed up the ability to schedule the next hour=20\nnon-firm.  This order is an important recognition by FERC that its OATT did=\n=20\nnot cover hourly, which we complained about alot at FERC's hotline last=20\nsummer.\n\n 2)  Successful in obtaining the release of all ISN (system information) to=\n=20\nmarketers in the WSCC region.  This was an individual effort by Dick that h=\nas=20\nbeen benificial for our traders in the WEST.  Successfully prevented the WS=\nCC=20\nOperating Committee from taking action that would have reversed this effort=\n. =20\n\n 3)  Assisted in getting the initial control areas in SERC approved last ye=\nar=20\nand preventing ATC changes this year and OC changes that would have negated=\n=20\nthe Control Area effort.\n\n 4)  Dick served as Co CHAIR of the ISO committee that put the SPP contract=\n=20\nin place that eliminated MW mile pricing in SPP and will serve as the basis=\n=20\nfor SPP's RTO.  =20\n\n 5) Dick was appointed to the NERC Control Area Task Force which was formed=\n=20\nas a result of our the success of the Enron Control Areas in TVA and have s=\no=20\nfar been successful in keeping this effort so that it is non punitive.  Thi=\ns=20\nhas turned into a very positive process that may result in a new=20\nconfiguration of the NERC relibiability effort.\n\n (6) Dick's made comments to ENTERGY that helped push Entergy into filing=\n=20\ntheir new scheduling procedure (ultimate source and sink) with FERC.  This=\n=20\nwas initially going to be implemented unilaterally March 1 without a FERC=\n=20\nfiling and Enron would have been forced into an after the fact complaint=20\nsituation at FERC where we are not allowed to get damages that we would hav=\ne=20\nincurred in the meantime (See Comm. Massey's concurrence in Aquila v. Enter=\ngy=20\nabout the lack of incentive to file complaints).  Kevin Presto said that=20\nwinning the protest at FERC (due 4/12) would be worth $100 MM.\n\n (7)  On 2/2, TECO revised its proposed generator imbalance charge from=20\nminute by minute to hourly accountability (notably, TECO revised its propos=\nal=20\nbefore FERC issued an order based on the EPSA protest herein.) We worked wi=\nth=20\nEPSA to file an EPSA protest to TECO=01,s proposal.  We didn=01,t like TECO=\n's=20\nproposal but had commercial concerns about filing a protest in our own name=\n=20\n(since Enron is working with TECO on a project).   We were able to get EPSA=\n=20\nto protest this issue in TECO's initial filing.  Enron is planning to site=\n=20\ngeneration in Florida, but we don't have the value on this win yet.\n\n             (8)  FERC issued a NOPR on January 28 proposing to revise the=\n=20\nway it assesses annual charges to public utilities.  Enron, along with=20\nseveral other participants (Dynegy, Koch, APX, Citizens, NP Energy, Sonat a=\nnd=20\nWilliams), filed a petition for rulemaking with FERC in August, 1998,=20\nrequesting FERC to revise its methodology for assessing annual charges,=20\narguing that FERC's current system of assessing annual charges on sales for=\n=20\nresale of power discourages trading, impedes reliance on competitive market=\ns=20\nfor power, and could create competitive advantages for utilities over new=\n=20\npower marketers entering the market.  We proposed that FERC either assess i=\nts=20\ncosts on transmission only, or reallocate the amounts that it collects=20\nthrough sales transactions versus transmission transactions.  Although FERC=\n=20\ndoes not grant our petition and in fact dismisses it as moot, the petition=\n=20\nserved its purpose.\n\nIn the NOPR, FERC notes that because most of its time is spent on=20\ntransmission issues (a point that we made in the Petition), it is appropria=\nte=20\nto assess costs only on the MWh of electric energy transmitted in interstat=\ne=20\ncommerce by public utilities.  Under the current assessment system, FERC=20\ndivides its costs between transmission and sales.  Now FERC is proposing to=\n=20\ncollect its costs solely through transmission.  FERC justifies this change=\n=20\nbecause it spends most of its time on transmission issues, and because=20\ntransmission providers can collect the fees through transmission charges=20\nassessed to users of the grid.  FERC proposes to asses its costs to 1)=20\nunbundled wholesale transmission; 2) unbundled retail transmission; and 3)=\n=20\nbundled wholesale power sales.  Bundled native load transactions will=20\napparently avoid assessments of any FERC-related costs; however, EPSA and=\n=20\nEnron are protesting this issue at FERC.  (Jim Steffes has been working on =\na=20\ncalculation of additional value.)\n\n (9)  Interconnection Policy =01) Utilizing EPSA efforts, including Sarah's=\n=20\nmeeting with FERC, we got the policy statement we urged FERC to put forth (=\nin=20\nthe forum we suggested, i.e., an existing proceeding) in the Tennessee Powe=\nr=20\norder where FERC said interconnection procedures should follow the pro form=\na=20\ntariff, including that a generator doesn't have to request transmission and=\n=20\ninterconnection at the same time.  We worked with EPSA to draft the \"Model\"=\n=20\ninterconnection agreement that EPSA filed at FERC in the Entergy=20\ninterconnection proposal.\n\n (10)  AEP/CSW order =01) approved the merger but accepted intervenors=01,=\n=20\ntestimony showing market power and conditioned merger on an independent=20\ncalculation of ATC postings (which we proposed) and independent market=20\nmonitor soon after the merger occurs with RTO participation by 12/15/01. =\n=20\nKevin Presto said the independent ATC calculation is worth $20 MM to Enron.=\n =20\n(Note: we are going to propose MAIN instead of SPP, which AEP chose.).  Kev=\nin=20\nsaid that AEP's ATC calculation can trump all interfaces in ECAR, so this h=\nas=20\na positive effect not just on AEP, but on all of ECAR.\n\n (11) MAPP =01) FERC further order on refunds.  MAPP refused to refund moni=\nes=20\nthat it was unable to collect from a non-jurisdictional member transmission=\n=20\nowner, NPPD.  EPMI filed a protest to MAPP=01,s refund report, arguing that=\n MAPP=20\nwas ordered to make full refunds and it violated that order.  FERC agreed=\n=20\nwith Enron and rejected MAPP=01,s refund report.  FERC said MAPP must refun=\nd the=20\nfull amount to transmission customers, whether or not it was able to collec=\nt=20\nthat money from NPPD.  Results in another $50,000 of refunds for EPMI.\n\n (12)  Sarah is working on the PGE sale.\n\n"

The Commission's rationale was that grandfathering \ngives all shippers notice of the new limitation and the opportunity to \nre-execute current contracts.  The TW Commercial Group has asked whether we \nshould challenge the grandfathering of existing contracts.  In limiting the \nright of first refusal, the Commission has expressly acknowledged that if a \ncustomer is truly captive and has no alternatives for service, it is likely \nthat its contract will be at the maximum rate.  Shippers that are not captive \nand have alternatives in the marketplace do not need the protection of ROFR, \nand the pipeline should be able to negotiate with other interested shippers \nupon expiration of the contract. \n \nIn light of these conclusions, there should be no reason to grandfather the \nROFR rights of shippers under existing discounted contracts.  Such shippers \nwould not be harmed by removal of the right immediately upon the effective \ndate of a pipeline's tariff filing to limit the right of first refusal \n(assuming the service contract incorporates tariff terms on an \"as amended\" \nbasis).  Consistent with the Commission's order, it would not be unfair to \nmake these shippers compete with others for the capacity upon expiration of \nthe contract.  \n\n"

          "body": "Lorraine:  here's what we would have to show FERC, along with some of my \ncomments.  Let me know if you have additional ideas, and I'll turn it into a \ndraft to send around to the usual suspects.  \n\n1.  Rate impact on TW customers; method by which TW would collect the costs \nof the acquired capacity.  \n\n -  I assume TW would be at risk for any undercollection of revenue \nassociated with the PNM capacity; thus there is no cost-shift potential to \nother shippers.  \n - Net costs will be separately recorded.\n\n2.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity enable TW to gain control over access \nto upstream capacity and supply sources in a manner which would permit TW to \nlimit customer choices or improperly tie use of the acquired capacity to \nother pipeline services?  (I think Mary Kay will be able to help us explain \nthe \"no tying\" part).\n\n3.  Would TW's marketing affiliates receive preferential treatment?  \n\n - No TW marketing affiliate will be involved in the proposed transaction\n - Acquisition of PNM capacity will not result in any undue preference or \nadvantage to any affiliated entity.\n\n4.  Will TW as a holder of capacity receive preferential treatment over PNM's \ncustomers, to the detriment of PNM's customers?  \n\n - No.  PNM will be making the capacity available to TW only during periods \nin which it has unused capacity available on its system, so any impact on PNM \nshippers should be minimal.  \n - Service contract under PNM's tariff does not provide for unduly \npreferential treatment of TW.\n\n5.  How will capacity be managed or otherwise integrated into TW's existing \nopen access operations?  \n\n - TW will enter into service agreements with PNM from time to time to \ntransport gas on the portion of PNM's line from Blanco, NM (i.e., the Blanco \nHub operated by TW) to Rio Puerco, NM, where PNM's system interconnects with \nTW's mainline.  Resulting available capacity will be posted according to TW's \ntariff.  \n - The capacity will be used to serve customers under TW's FTS-1, LFT and ITS \n(right?) rate schedules from the Blanco receipt point to delivery points on \nTW's system.  \n - Lorraine -- we need to discuss our arrangement with PNM -- Would we be \nable to acquire on an as-needed basis?  Would it be an ordinary service \nagreement as provided in their tariff?  Which would come first, our deal with \nPNM or with our shipper?  It might be good to come up with some examples of \nlikely scenarios.\n\n6.  Would acquisition of PNM capacity prevent unnecessary construction of new \nfacilities?  \n\n - Yes.  Demand currently exceeds available capacity on the San Juan \nLateral.  Transwestern was unable to construct San Juan Phase II because of \nprohibitively high costs of obtaining an easement on Navajo land.  Using the \nPNM Blanco to Rio Puerco line is one of the few remaining alternatives \navailable to TW to expand this portion of its system.  It would enable TW to \ntransport an additional ______ of gas for shippers from the San Juan Basin to \ndelivery points on the mainline of TW's system without the need for expanding \nthe San Juan lateral.  The acquired capacity would benefit customers by \neffectively providing incremental capacity on a constrained portion of TW's \nsystem, at minimal cost to TW and no environmental disturbance.  Would enable \nboth TW and PNM to use their systems more efficiently.\n"

Here is a last draft of our GPG rehearing \ncomments.  Please forward any additional comments no later than noon, Friday \nMarch 10.\n\nSignificant changes from the last draft are as follows:\n1.  We are asking the Commission to eliminate the peak/off-peak cost & \nrevenue study, rather than clarify that the study applies only to excess \nrevenues. (p.2)\n2. References to the TW Global Settlement have been removed. The reference to \nexisting settlements is more generic and included only to preserve our \nrights. (p.4)\n3. A new argument on ROFR has been added.  We are asking the Commission to \nimmediately apply the new policy that ROFR does not apply to discount rate \nagreements. (p.5-6)\n4.Several reporting arguments have been deleted -- masking shipper names, \nclarifying that only senior employee names have to be posted and clarifying \nthe Sept. 1 reporting date.  With respect to these last two arguments, we \nhave decided that we can interpret it our way without further clarification.\n5.New clarification concerning the date for which the lifting of the price \ncaps on capacity release is to be implemented.\n\n\n\n"

          "subject": "California Western Storage Initiatives",
          "body": "Note:  Let me know if we need to gather more information on these storage \ninitiatives.  I would be happy to research further.\nLorna\n\nCA Gets 2nd Merchant Storage Project, 3rd on the Way\n\n      Setting aside vociferous local opposition from nearby property owners \nand a proposed denial from one of its\n      administrative law judges (ALJ), the California Public Utilities \nCommission Thursday gave the go-ahead to a\n      proposed $80 million underground natural gas storage field near Lodi in \nNorthern California. \n\n      Texas-based Western Hub Properties' $80 million Lodi storage project is \ndesigned to have 12 Bcf of working\n      capacity, with 400 MMcf/d injection and 500 MMcf/d withdrawal capacity. \nIt includes a 35-mile transmission\n      pipeline that connects with Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s backbone \npipeline. It will be the state's second\n      non-utility storage project, following Wild Goose storage which went \ninto service last year. Approval of the Lodi\n      project is effective in mid-June. \n\n      While CPUC Commissioner Richard Bilas said he supports \"letting the \nmarket decide\" whether a project should\n      be built and encourages competition in gas storage, he \"cannot support \nallowing competitors to use regulatory\n      loopholes to take advantage of private property owners. In my view, \nthis case comes precariously close to\n      allowing that to happen.\" \n\n      Although the Lodi project won environmental approval from an ALJ, the \njudge recommended the project not be\n      built because it didn't meet local-need criteria. \n\n      After postponing a decision on the proposed denial of the project, the \nCPUC president and one of the other five\n      commissioners developed an alternative that gives \"conditional\" \ncertification to the project so it can proceed with\n      development and construction. To do so, Western Hub will have to comply \nwith all the designated environmental\n      mitigation measures, obtain adequate insurance and gain other state \npermits, including the State Lands\n      Commission. \n\n      Western Hub officials have maintained that Lodi's unique geographical \nlocation with proximity to key electric\n      generating plants will be the state's only underground storage project \noffering fast deliverability to meet the needs\n      of an increasingly competitive generation market. \n\n      In sympathizing with the local concerns regarding this project, \nCommissioner Bilas said the opposition efforts of\n      Lodi residents \"have not been wasted. They highlight the need for [the \nCPUC] to continually review how its\n      policies mesh with changing market conditions and how these \ninteractions affect people. This will continue to be a\n      delicate balancing act.\" The CPUC unanimous decision, Bilas said, \n\"attempts to make that balance.\" \n\n      Five local property owners --- one immediately adjacent to the proposed \nproject --- traveled to San Francisco\n      to urge the regulators to reject Western Hub's applications. They \ncalled the company \"very arrogant\" in the way it\n      treated local landowners and argued that the project would \n\"significantly adversely affect the quality of life\" in\n      their community. \n\n      Meanwhile, Western Hub is eyeing a second potential storage site near \nWheeler Ridge, southwest of\n      Bakersfield. It is hoping to help develop an important regional energy \nhub in the southern end of California's\n      central valley. The project would be similar in size to Lodi. \n\n      A merchant storage field in the Wheeler Ridge area would be in close \nproximity to each of the four major gas\n      pipelines in the state and to the sites for several proposed gas-fired \nmerchant power plants --- one of them,\n      PG&E Corp.'s La Paloma plant, which began construction May 17, will be \nthe state's largest merchant plant\n      (1,048 MW). \n\n      Western Hub anticipates moving through the state approval processes \nquicker and having the project operational\n      in the \"next two to three years,\" according to its California-based \nofficials. \n\n      \"This is a storage project that is very similar to the Lodi Project,\" \nsaid Jim Fossum, Western Hub California\n      project manager. The concept of a project in the vicinity of Wheeler \nRidge is being used in Western's ongoing\n      marketing efforts to line up customers and equity financial support, \nbut there are no specific engineering plans or\n      draft regulatory filings in place. \n\n      Fossum said Western Hub owns some rights to depleted oil/gas properties \nin the area, which has a long history\n      of fossil fuel exploration and development covering much of the 20th \nCentury. \"We're working on the engineering\n      of it,\" he said, adding that he is not \"free to pinpoint precisely \nwhere [the proposed site] is located.\" \n\n      \"We have already told people that we intend to be interconnected with \nPG&E, Southern California Gas Co.,\n      Kern River and Mojave pipelines,\" he said. \"We intend to not only \nprovide service to the power plants in the\n      area, but to the Las Vegas area and to the power plants in Arizona.\" \n\n      Fossum said the expectation is that large customers in Nevada and \nArizona could store gas in California for the\n      peak-load times when they need extra supplies; take more than their \nnormal loads off the Kern River or Mojave\n      interstate pipeline and \"pay\" for the extra supplies out storage that \nwould go to uses in California. \n\n      \"On a hot summer day, a customer in Las Vegas may need more gas but \nthere is no capacity available because\n      everyone else wants it, too,\" Fossum said. \"So the Nevada customer \narranges to take extras from Shell or\n      Chevron [or one of the California-based customers] and supply that gas \nback to them at Wheeler Ridge.\" "

Benton, CQ Staff \nAt the dawn of the year, it seemed Congress would be content to let the \ncurrent session end without moving legislation to encourage further \nderegulation of the nation's $220 billion <electric> market. But developments \nin the past few weeks suggest that groups interested in seeing deregulation, \nas well as the Clinton administration, are building a consensus that will put \npressure on Congress to move some kind of bill this year.\nOn April 6, a group called the <Electricity> Restructuring Stakeholders -- \nrepresenting consumers, <electric> generating companies, senior citizens and \nothers -- released a set of goals they believe should be included in \nrestructuring legislation. The principles include repeal of the Public \nUtility Holding Company Act of 1935 (<PUHCA>) and changes to a 1978 law (PL \n95-617) that required state utility commissions and <utilities> to reform \ntheir <electric> rates and take other measures to even out daily <electric> \nconsumption. (1978 CQ Almanac, p. 639)\nThe group plans to meet with environmental groups and regulators to identify \nother areas where common ground can be reached, said Joe Nipper, chief \nlobbyist for the American Public Power Association.\nA smaller trade group, composed mainly of investor-owned <utilities>, is \nworking on its own set of principles.\nEnergy Secretary Bill Richardson acknowledged the stakeholder progress in an \nApril 17 speech to the National Energy Marketers Association, and he urged \nCongress to pass an <electric> restructuring bill.\n\"Our interstate <electricity> markets are in need of repair,\" Richardson \nsaid, adding that <transmission> access and generation capacity are \ndecreasing as demand for <electricity> grows. \"If Congress fails to act -- \nand act soon -- on restructuring legislation, it will strangle the \ndevelopment of competitive <electricity> markets.\"\nThe two committee chairmen who will have to spearhead a restructuring plan \nhave stated their intent to pass a bill by the end of the 106th Congress. But \nthey must navigate past obstacles that include the compressed calendar, \nelection-year politics and a general lack of knowledge among their colleagues \non how to rewrite or repeal <PUHCA>.\nOn April 27, Senate Energy Chairman Frank H. Murkowski, R-Alaska, will hold \nthe last of three hearings on eight <electric> deregulation-related measures.\nOn the House side, retiring Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas J. Bliley Jr., \nR-Va., has vowed to work toward enacting a bill (HR 2944) to encourage \nfurther state deregulation of the <electric> utility market. That measure, \nwhich would effectively allow consumers to buy their power from anyone, not \njust the nearest utility, was approved by the House Commerce Subcommittee on \nEnergy and Power on Oct. 27. (CQ Weekly, p. 478; 1999 CQ Weekly, p. 2599)\nThe bill also would give states the authority to handle their transition to a \ncompetitive market but contains no deadline, or \"date certain,\" by which \nstates would have to restructure.\nMoving a Senate Bill\nSome are skeptical that the political and practical hurdles can be overcome \nthis year. For example, while they have made progress on principles, the key \nnegotiators -- representing investor-owned <utilities>; <electric> \ncooperatives; municipal <electric> <utilities>; large <electricity> \nconsumers; labor unions, and environmental groups -- still must reach \nconsensus on details the legislation should address, as well as the \nlegislative language to implement any agreement.\n\"I think the chances of getting a bill enacted this year are low, not from \nthe lack of trying,\" Nipper said.\nThe best chance appears to lie in the Senate, where Murkowski's committee is \nconsidering eight bills. \"I am committed to getting something meaningful out \nof my committee,\" Murkowski said in an April 14 interview. Murkowski \nacknowledged, though, that the congressional schedule and narrow consensus on \neach of the bills pose challenges to his goal -- developing a comprehensive \nderegulation bill, not one that only addresses portions of <electric> \nrestructuring.\nThe path in the House appears more difficult, although one key supporter said \nthere is behind-the-scenes movement.\nBliley has promised to hold a markup of HR 2944 before Memorial Day, and he \nhas named a task force of six members to help move the bill through committee.\nJoe L. Barton, R-Texas, the sponsor of HR 2944, said meetings are taking \nplace among Bliley, Republican House staffers and some interested groups. \n\"There is some action; it's just not visible,\" Barton said late last month. \n\"I think what's happening there is that [stakeholders are] jockeying for \nposition.\"\nBarton said he anticipated that a \"fairly good bill\" could be moved by the \nmiddle of May if stakeholders and members come together.\nOne complication: Democrats, in the midst of the battle to regain control of \nthe House, may not move toward a consensus with Republicans. Staff aides for \nseveral Democratic members have already complained they have not heard from \nthe committee staff in trying to work out differences raised in subcommittee.\nBut others point to a 1992 energy law (PL 102-486) that cleared Congress in \nthe weeks before that year's election. It contained provisions allowing <\nutilities> and independent producers to compete in the wholesale power \nmarket; that law has been credited with the current wave of deregulation in \nsome markets. So far, 25 states and the District of Columbia have either \nrestructured their markets or enacted laws to begin retail competition in \ncoming years. (1992 Almanac, p. 231)\nMark Stultz, a spokesman for the <Electric> <Power> Supply Association, a \ngroup of competitive power suppliers and power marketers, said the 1992 law \nwas enacted after the <electric> industry quickly built up a consensus among \nmembers and educated them on what the bill would do.\n\"The industry was able to access that in a very short time,\" Stultz said. As \nfar as getting a restructuring bill through this year, Stultz said it is \"not \nan impossible, unrealizable goal to assume that we could get consensus,\" \nsince key stakeholders have reached agreement on several issues. They include \nblocking \"market power\" -- the ability of a few companies to stunt \ncompetition by effectively using its assets to manipulate the deregulated \nmarket to its advantage.\nWhile the House bill contains many issues stakeholders agree with, Stultz \nsaid it also contains some fatal flaws. He cited as an example its lack of \nfederal agency jurisdiction over \"bundled\" services in a regulated market, in \nwhich <electric> generation, <transmission> and distribution rates are \ncombined in an <electric> bill, and \"unbundled\" services in a deregulated \nmarket, in which the generation rates are broken apart from <transmission> \nand distribution rates and other temporary charges brought on by deregulation \nare included.\nBest Bets in the Senate\nOf the eight bills pending in the Senate, Nipper said the one with the best \nchance of passing is S 2071, sponsored by Slade Gorton, R-Wash., which is \nintended to encourage greater <electric> <reliability>. Nipper said the \nGorton bill would replace the North American <Electric> <Reliability> \nCouncil, a group in which utility participation is voluntary, with the <\nElectric> <Reliability> Organization, a board that would require \nparticipation by <utilities>. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would \nhave jurisdiction over the board, as well as the power to enforce its \npolicies on <utilities>.\nThe reliability issue is likely to intensify in coming months, due to \nproblems <electric> <utilities> faced each of the past two summers. While \nsome plants were undergoing needed maintenance, some <utilities> were caught \nwith their generation capacity down during periods of extremely high demand. \nThe resulting shortage triggered a spike in bulk <electric> prices, driving \nthe price of a megawatt-hour of <electricity> in a few places from $30 to as \nhigh as $7,000. <Utilities> enforced rotating blackouts on customers, asked \nconsumers to reduce <electric> use and passed on surcharges for the higher \ncost of <electricity>.\nHoping to avoid outages this summer, the Department of Energy has scheduled \nfour regional \"summits\" on <electric> <reliability> on April 24 and 28.\nJim Owen, a spokesman for the Edison <Electric> Institute, said a third \nconsecutive summer of service interruptions and significant price increases \ncould motivate Congress to move on the deregulation bill. \"It might push this \nthing up further on the congressional radar screen,\" although a law enacted \nimmediately would not have a quick impact on generation and <transmission> \nreliability, he said.\nOther thorny issues include:\n? How to handle taxation issues between publicly owned <utilities>, <electric\n> cooperatives and municipal <utilities>, and whether <utilities> should \nvoluntarily join, or be forced to join, \"regional <transmission> \norganizations\" designed to allow more efficient transfer of <electricity> \nacross the national grid.\n? Whether the federal government should be involved in regulating the \ninterstate <transmission> of <electric> <power>. Some stakeholders argue \nfederal regulation is necessary to prevent one state or region from \nprotecting its customers at the expense of others.\n? Environmental groups' desire for stronger anti-pollution restrictions on <\nutilities> that produce pollutants while generating <electricity>. And labor \ngroups, wary that deregulation could trigger massive layoffs through \ncorporate mergers and acquisitions, want to make sure their union members are \nprotected.\n\n"

The key points coming \nout of the meeting are as follows:\n\n1.  Regulatory Capital\n\nThis did not feature in the discussion at all and I did not raise the issue.  \nI suspect we are unlikely to hear more on this from SFA until the July \ninspection (at the earliest).\n\n2. Enron's new SFA procedures\n\nI delivered to SFA a file containing the new SFA procedures we have produced \nfor each relevant group within Enron Europe; I also described the change in \nour SFA officers and our efforts to build a \"compliance culture\".  SFA were \nclearly impressed with the new procedures and indicated that our approach was \na good one, given the increase in our size, staff movements etc.  They said \nthey are trying to introduce their own written procedures within SFA!\n\n3. SFA's July Inspection\n\nThis was described as being an \"overview visit\" which would last two days \n(possibly slightly longer) and be carried out by Karen Wilson (our \nrelationship manager at SFA), plus two others.  The purpose of the inspection \nis for SFA to assess the extent of our compliance systems, processes and \nculture.  I have been asked to provide to SFA, before the inspection, a \ndescription of our European businesses and a list of those people who we \nthink it would be useful for SFA to meet.  Note, however, that SFA will be \nfree to speak to anyone they wish to, to assess our level of compliance \nawareness.  We will therefore need to embark on an extensive internal \neducation program before July to make sure all relevant staff understand and \nimplement our new procedures which the group heads have approved.\n\nOur procedures, policies and documents will all be reviewed by SFA, but at a \nfairly high level.  There will be an initial meeting with SFA and a close out \nmeeting at the end of the inspection which will highlight areas of deficiency \n(they always find some) which we will then have several weeks to put right.  \nThey will wish to know whether we can \"weather a financial storm\"; they will \nwish to assess the quality of our management and management systems; and they \nwill wish to check on our systems generally (e.g. how much is automated, how \nmuch involves manual checking).  They will also review our then current \nfinancial return and accounting records to ensure they are being properly \nprepared.  Any serious breaches discovered could lead to further \ninvestigation and disciplining/penalties, but the purpose of the inspection \nis, in their words, not \"to trip us up\".\n\nOverall, they will be forming an impression of Enron and will give us a one \nto five ranking depending on how comfortable they feel with our compliance.  \nThis will determine how they treat Enron going forward (i.e. the more \ncomfortable they feel, the fewer visits we can expect).\n\n4. Recent Developments at Enron\n\nI highlighted a number of recent developments within Enron, stressing the \nphysical (unregulated) aspect of our business (e.g. sale of Sutton Bridge).  \nThey agreed that, given our unique mixture of physical and financial \nbusinesses, there are no comparators for Enron.  \n\nInterestingly, they were already aware of Enron Online even though we had not \nnotified them about it.  They did not seem concerned about Enron Online, but \nsaid that the system was one thing (among others) they would wish to take a \nlook at during the July inspection.\n\n\n Paul "

          "subject": "RE: GIR",
          "body": "Let me clarify two of the more substantive matters that were not included in \nthe errata - Wheeler Ridge and the Pooling Revisions.? The first, Wheeler \nRidge, was not included in the errata because of concerns expressed by IP and \nORA about the impact these changes would have on Kern River shippers.? \nSoCalGas did not oppose the revision and would accept the language as \nproposed by PG&E, especially if it would gain their non-opposition.? There \nwas also a concern expressed by some parties that the WR revisions went \nbeyond the bounds of an errata and should be considered a revision of the \nsettlement.?? As for the Pooling Revisions, Dynegy expressed reservations \nabout the proposed changes that included substantial increases in the number \nof pools available per shipper.? Dynegy was not able to garner internal \napproval in time for us to prepare the errata for filing later today, so \nPooling revisions were taken off the table.? SoCalGas supports the pooling \nrevisions and no other party expressed any concerns.? ALJ Biren asked us to \nfile a revised settlement document with the corrected pages included and to \nmail it out to the parties today, so our already compressed deadline for \ngetting this out the door was even more compressed.? \n\nSince I was unable to get resolution from all of the parties of the \noutstanding differences, I could not include the revisions that were \ncirculated (to our dismay).? PG&E has now indicated they will file limited \nopposition and they have now served a discovery request upon SoCalGas with \nregard to Wheeler Ridge.\n\n\n-----Original Message----- \nFrom: Craig Chancellor [mailto:craigc@calpine.com] \nSent: Friday, April 28, 2000 8:15 AM \nTo: 'Cherry, Brian - TPBKC'; 'AlexanMS@sce.com'; 'paulamirault@aec.ca'; \n'david.bayless@utility.com'; 'Tomb@crossborderenergy.com'; \n'Burkee@cts.com'; Craig Chancellor; 'Rick.Counihan@greenmountain.com'; \n'Jdasovic@enron.com'; 'Mday@gmssr.com'; 'bdingwall@unitedgas.com'; \n'Douglass@arterhadden.com'; 'eke@aelaw.com'; 'Jfawcet@enron.com'; \n'rfoss@coral-energy.com'; 'plg@cpuc.ca.gov'; 'johnj@bcjlaw.com'; \n'Johnson_Pamela@lacoe.edu'; 'karpjos@sf.whitecase.com'; \n'jleslie@luce.com'; 'kmccrea@sablaw.com'; 'jmpa@dynegy.com'; \n'rmp@cpuc.ca.gov'; 'porterdk@sce.com'; 'RochmanM@cubjpa.org'; \n'RochmanM@spurr.org'; 'susan.scott@enron.com'; Beamish, Richard - TPRMB; \nBetonte, Robert - TP2RSB; Brill, Thomas R.; Cotton, Gary; Davis, Robert \nE.; Davis, Steven D.; Fair, Pam; Follett, B.

The primary issues that I see are as follows:\n\n (1) whether new generation projects require a certificate of need or similar \ngrant of authority from state authorities, and if so, what is entailed in \nobtaining  such authority ;\n\n (2) the degree to which, if any, the owners of such projects fall within the \nregulatory jurisdiction of state PUCs (as a public utility or otherwise);\n\n (3) whether there are state siting requirements (and if so, what are they); \nand \n\n (4) an assessment of local zoning requirements.\n\nObviously, there may also be environmental permitting issues as well - is \nthat something you are looking for a state-by-state assessment of as well?\n\nI will send to you a memo that was prepared recently for ENA/Pulp & Paper \nrelative to a small generation project in Wisconsin.  The purpose of sending \nyou the memo is to determine whether the issues analyzed in that context are \nsimilar to those you are confronting.  I will need more information about the \nprojects to get started.  Please call me when you have a chance to discuss \nthis matter.  -Bob (3-3180)     \n\n\n\n\n\n"

          "body": "Late breaking good news!  Attached find Rich Hall's testimony on behalf of \nPG&E.  It would appear that Mr. Baldwin's extensive lobbying efforts have \npaid off here.  Nowhere do I see a specific reference to Hector \nRoad/Transwestern as another example of the Comprehensive Settlement's \nfailure to deal with the allocation problem at Wheeler Ridge.  That being \nsaid, I note that the \"generic\" prescription sponsored by PG&E applies in all \ncases where, \"the combined capacity of the upstream interconnects exceeds the \ndownstream take-away capacity.\"   Anyone paying close attention, or anyone \nwith an axe to grind here, will be quick to point out that there maybe other \nexamples similar to Wheeler-- can you say, \"Hector Road?\"\n\nWe'll just have to deal with questions on the application of the generic rule \nduring the hearings.  I think it good news that PG&E chose not to spell it \nout for anyone.  Maybe we owe them one after all?  Thoughts?\n\n\n\n\n---------------------- Forwarded by Jeffery Fawcett/ET&S/Enron on 05/05/2000 \n06:28 PM ---------------------------\n\n\n\"Gluzgold, Yevgeniya\" <YxG4@pge.com> on 05/05/2000

          "body": "Not much has happened with the federal filings since we submitted them (SEC \napplication was filed on February 4, FERC application was filed on March 3).  \nAnn has been keeping everyone updated on the DOJ review of the HSR filing.  \n\nWith regard to the FERC filing, FERC separated the section 203 merger \napplication from the section 205 joint open access tariff filing.   \nInterventions and protests to the joint transmission tariff (which will be \nused by the merged companies once the merger occurs), were due to be filed at \nthe end of March.  Interventions and protests to the section 203 application \nare due May 3.  \n\nOne party asked FERC to extend the deadline for interventions and protests on \nthe tariff to be extended to May 3, and FERC granted that request.  However, \nseveral parties filed interventions before FERC granted the extension, so \nsome comments have been filed.  The only significant substantive comment came \nfrom the Public Utility Commission of Nevada (PUCN).  PUCN opposes the \nmerging parties' license plate rate proposal and instead favors a rolled-in \nrate structure (where the rates of the three individual systems -- Nevada \nPower, Sierra Pacific, and Portland General) are averaged together so that \ntransmission customers on any of the three systems would pay the same \ntransmission rate, regardless of which system they use.  \n\nWe have some answers to this protest.  First, one of FERC's main concerns \nwith regard to transmission rates is the elimination of pancaked rates \n(paying multiple transmission rates for moving over multiple systems).  The \njoint open access tariff eliminates pancaking and uses instead a license \nplate approach (pay the rate of the system where the power is being delivered \nand have transmission access over all three systems for that one rate).  \nSecond, if the rates are averaged together, rate payers in the low cost \nregion will pay a higher transmission rate.  Third, depending on the RTO \nconfiguration, PGE could be in a separate RTO from Sierra and Nevada, so \ndifferent rates, at least for PGE, would be warranted.  \n\nWe plan on filing an answer to the PUCN protest at the same time we file an \nanswer to the other protests and comments that will be filed on May 3.   FERC \ndoes not typically allow answers to protests, so we did not want to submit \nmultiple answers to the various pleadings.  We expect the majority of \nprotests to be filed in the section 203 merger application docket.  Once we \nsee the extent of the protests, we will have a better idea of whether FERC \nshould be able to issue an order on the merger by the end of July (before \nthey leave for August recess).\n\nThe SEC proceeding has been quiet.  There are four major mergers ahead of our \napplication (AEP/CSW, Energy East, NSP/New Century, ComEd/PECO), so we do not \nexpect the SEC to focus on our filing until they are closer to ruling on \nthese other mergers.  \n\nWe will keep you posted on any significant events on the federal side.  In \nthe meantime, please call or email me if you have any questions.\n\nSarah\n"

Counsel \nfor SCGC has informed me that he does not intend to file a motion to compel \nanswers to these questions by any other parties. \n\nCounsel for TURN has informed me that it does not intend to file a motion to \ncompel other parties to whom it sent its April 27 data request to answer any \nof those questions, but that TURN is not now willing to waive any right to \nfile such a motion. \n\nThe ALJ has stated her intent to rule on the TURN motion and the expected \nSCGC motion at the PHC on Thurs. May 25.? SoCalGas has agreed to file a \nwritten response by Tues. May 23, as TURN had proposed.? The ALJ does not \nintend to issue a formal, written ruling shortening time to respond to the \nmotions, but wants to be sure parties understand her intent on how she will \nproceed in resolving this matter. \n\n-- Glen Sullivan \nSempra Energy Law Dept. \ntel:?

I note that the same\ninterrogatories that TURN withdrew, SCGC is withdrawing.  Therefore, my\noriginal view that we can deal with this without taking up time at the PHC\nstill stands.  I would like you to try to work this out by yourselves based\nupon my indication here as to how I will rule.\n\nThe bottom line is that SoCalGas must respond to those interrogatories\nseeking to clarify which settlement is its first choice.  It is by no means\ncrystal clear, and does impact the breadth of support for each settlement.\n(In fact, I'd like to know SDG&E's view on this too.)  I think this could be\ndone in a limited way as opposed to responses to all the interrogatories\ncomparing the two settlements.  Whether SoCalGas has breached the Interim\nSettlement by also signing the Comprehensive Settlement is not directly\nrelevant to this proceeding.  I don't need to determine that and I don't\nwant to expand this already far-ranging proceeding to include that - take it\nto court if you want to.  Moreover, some of the questions are now moot as\nall prepared testimony has been lodged.  So, please meet and confer again.\nIf you can't come to an agreement based on my views in this email, then\nSoCalGas should file its Opposition on the 23rd, and I'll rule on each\ninterrogatory on the 25th.  Please let me know ASAP if you've worked\nsomething out.\n\n--Judge Biren\n\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: Sullivan, Glen J.

Also,  the \nmili-second that the funds plunked into the Lockbox a virulent \"Security \nInterest\" attached itself like a vampire to the juggler vein of these funds \nand this security interest was for our benefit.  \n\n Although I am proud to have the  name Yoder associated with the Lockbox \nconcept,  I must in all modesty confess I have never closed out a real deal \nusing the damn thing.

Nonetheless, we \nshould try and focus our testimony on those things in the Post-Interim that \nare objectionable and inconsistent with the Commission's Most Promising \nOptions.? I would use all of our \"powder\" on the Post-Interim arguments and \nlimit our opinions on the viability of the Interim (at least some of the \nInterim signatories will take this approach).??

Below is a \npartial listing of what we like and don't like in it. \n\n\nPositives:\n\n choice as of October 1, 2002 for all customers\n\n strong codes of conduct (with penalties)\n\n metering and billing competitive\n\n large customers have SOS for one year only\n\n uniform unbundling  (muni and coops all post to a common web site)\n\n \"shopping credit\" increases each year that transition costs are collected\n\n  \nNegatives:\n\n divestiture is not required \n\n stranded cost is thru lost revenue approach \n\n SOS is in place for at least 6 years for residential/commercial (although \nIUB may bid out wholesale at some point)\n\n certification of suppliers is convoluted (we won't have trouble--it's just \nvery prescriptive)\n\n \n\n\nDescription of Enviromental section:\n\nThe current bill provides for an RPS that ramps up to 8% in 2011.  \nAdditinally, monies are collected thru a non bypassable wires charge totaling \napprox. $50 million per year.  These monies are deposited with the Dept of \nNatural Resources, who is charged with designing programs that \nencourage/subsidize the development of renewable resources in Iowa.  If \ndevelopers use this fund for their project, they must then offer renewable \npower to competitive energy suppliers for their 8% requirment at a \"market \nrate\".  A credit trading program is allowed. Competitive suppliers can meet \ntheir RPS requirment with sources from outside the state. If the DNR is not \nable to design subsidy programs that work, the IUB has the right to waive the \nRPS requirment for competitive electric suppliers.  As I described to you in \nour phone conversations, this agreement is as far as the customers would go \nin the renewable negotiations and this section has been agreed to by the \ngovernor.\n\nThe DNR and other enviromental groups continue to push for an amendment that \nde couples the RPS  from the DNR performance (makes the RPS hard, with no \nright to waive by IUB); that requires all renewables that are used by the \ncompetitors to Iowa based and that they have to be built after 2000. They \nalso want significant financial penalties beyond the penalties already in the \nbill for certification infractions.  All of these proposals are deal breakers \nfor the customers--who believe that competitors will not come to Iowa if \nthere are too many hoops to jump thru (Illinois next door has no renewable \nrequriments).\n\n\nConclusion\n\nSince we have as one of our top tens goals for the government affairs group \nthat we get 2 more states to pass legislation in 2000, I see this bill as a \npositive for us in trying to reach that goal.  As described in my previous \nupdates, however, the bill is now ALL about politics, and passage rests with \nleadership. \n \n\n \n\n "

It is available on the Publications page of my website: \nwww.EHirst.com.\n\nThe key problems I identify include:  \n\nDeclining generation reserve margins,  \n\nDeclining transmission capacity relative to load, leading to  \n\nIncreasing transmission congestion, and  \n\nGrowing number and complexity of bulk-power transactions.  \n\nThe primary solutions I discuss include:  \n\nFederal legislation to (1) extend FERC authority over the entire bulk-power \nindustry for reliability and (2) oversee a single North American reliability \norganization that sets mandatory standards;  \n\nLarge regional transmission organizations;  \n\nDecide who decides where and when to build new transmission lines, with \nregional solutions? likely better than local ones; and?  \n\nExpand demand-side participation in energy and ancillary-service markets.  \n\n\n\nPlease let me know if you have any comments on the paper.\n\nEric\n----------------------------------------------\nEric Hirst\nConsulting in Electric-Industry Restructuring\n106 Capital Circle\nOak Ridge, TN 37830\n865-482-5470 (phone & fax)???

Another item that may be worth mentioning is that expected \ndeclining CTC rates and the eventual drop off of the charge to payback Rate \nReduction Bonds will offset potential increases in future transmission and \ndistribution rates.  Transmission rates are expected to increase from cost \nshifting under the ISO TAC proposal.  Also transmission investments to \nalleviate transmission constraints will be partially offset by the avoidance \nof RMR costs.  PG&E will file another distribution rate change for 2002 that \nmay result in a significant adjustment, but distribution rates are expected \nto level off after that once a PBR has been implemented.

The following is a summary \nof what occured at the meeting.\n\nThe Network\nMCI built the system.\nThe ISO currently shares its private, dedicated network 50-50 with the \nCalifornia Power Exchange, though the ISO like to take control of 100% of the \nasset.\nThe network consists of 4 OC-12s (?) and as part of the contract, the ISO has \na call to upgrade an no or very little cost to 4 OC-48s.\nThis \"scalability\" was built in to accommodate what California believed would \nbe a very large and rapidly growing number of users (mostly scheduling \ncoordinators), but California greatly underestimated the number.  So the ISO \nis left with considerable excess capacity.\nIt's an ATM switched network with 11 A-PoPs and 4 B-Pops and it runs from \nFolsom (Sacramento) to Alhambra (around Pasadena).  The B-PoP locations are \nHayward, Sacramento, Long Beach, and Claremont.\n\nThe Contract\nThe ISO pays about $30-35 million/yr under the contract---significantly above \nmarket.\nThe contract ends at the end of 2003.\nThe contract includes a costless, or very low cost, option to upgrade from \nOC-12 to OC-48.\nThe contract also permits interconnection to the network (by MCI) for $485, \nirrespective of difference from the grid.\n\nThe Goals of the EVP/CIO\n\nReduce costs immediately.   Needs to take a plan designed to mitigate the \ncosts to the Board in 60 days.\nWants to maintain some flexibility in the event usage grows.\n\"Would like to do a short term deal, for \"nonfirm\" service and get  a high \nprice,\" but he would do a long-term, firm deal if it reduced his costs \nsignificantly.\n\n\n"

          "body": "I spoke with John Nimmons regarding the subject settlement discussions on \nTuesday.  He shared with me his view on several matters.\n\n1.  He's not sure what SCE is up to.  He believes they will not move off of \ntheir position of DG ownership however convoluted it may be (basically they \nwant to keep the \"option open\" of customer-side DG ownership).  He also \nbelieves they most likely will not participate in further discussions.  He \nhas a call into SCE to see if he can come to some understanding on where they \nstand.  (He also said they indicated they are most likely going to drop out \nof DPCA).\n\n2.  John believes PG&E was responding to the Commission's position regrading \nDG ownership as outined in the Cmmisson's rule that states the Commission has \nnot found any compelling reason to prevent ownership of DG bu UDC's.  He \nthinks they are not interested in customer-side DG as a business but only as \nan option to site mobile DG under emergency conditions.  He also believes \nthat this issue is not a showstopper for them and they would most likely give \nit up (DG ownership) if others such as DPCA and Enron would support a PBR \nthat gave them the right incentives.\n\n3.  Next Monday's meeting will focus on the distribution only wheeling tariff \nissue (minutes of the last meeting and an agenda for Monday's meeting should \nbe out today).  He thinks this will be the most contentious issue of all \nbased on his reading of the utilities' testimony.  The utilities' postitions \nare that you can't separate distribution from transmission when dealing with \nthe grid since their is much interdepence.  \n\nI think we should continue to participate in these  meetings.  I'm planning \non participating by phone.  I don't expect SCE to participate but if we \nchange PGE's ownership position we would have 2 of the 3 utilities with us \nwhich strengthens our position.  It will also be interesting to see what the \nutilities have to say regarding distribution only tariffs.  ANy thoughts? \n"

This would include ownership, facility \noutput, markets for energy or capacity or ancillary sevices (if any) and \nmaintenance schedules (these schedules may be coincident with a retail \ncustomer's facility maintenance schedule which itself may be confidential \ninformation between the generator and retail customer).

By the end of the day Tuesday, it became clear to all \nparties that the bill would not be called for a vote.  The customers were \nunwilling to give anymore on the enviroment issues and the democrats would \nsimilarly not back off their positions.  Mid American then switched gears to \npull out all the stops on getting labor support in order to trump the enviro \nsupporters.  Mid American put forward a proposal to the unions/legislators \nthat they would commit to build 2 power plants in the state of Iowa (as \nopposed to developing in Illinois) over the next 5 years that would employ \nunion labor. Mid American also had it's top management making many visits \nthis week---Greg Abel and I believe also David Sokol.  (No Warren Buffet \nsightings yet!!!!)This offer created a flurry of activity on both sides, but \nat the end of the day Thursday, the state IBEW group let it be known that \nthey would still not support the bill even with the Mid Am proposal.\n\nMid American believes that the Republicans now have a hook to force the \ndemocrats into voting for the de reg bill, by saying that if they don't vote \naffirmative, they are not for economic development in the rural/struggling \nareas of the state where the power plants would be built.  \n\nWHile I may not share Mid American's positive assessment, the proponent's \ngroup continues it's advocacy and will meet with legilsators in their \ndistricts over the weekend.

The chair(republican) of the Senate committee \nhad a hearing this morning to consider all of the enviromental amendments put \nforward by the Democrats and it was clear that no Dems would vote for the \neventual bill without their amendments, so the chair recessed the committee \nwithout a vote.

As you will \nrecall, the House Republicans have always stated that they needed Democrat \nvotes in order to bring the matter to the floor for a vote.  Despite Governor \nVilsack's stated support for the measure last week as well as last weekend, \nthe House  Democrat leadership is unwilling to push their members, as they \nwant to use this bill against the Republicans in the House races this fall. \n(The tactic they will take is that residential rates will rise in the \nSoutheastern part of the state due to the Republicans passing the bill).\n\nThe primary issue that the Dems are using as a reason not to vote for the \nbill is that the enviromental protections/funds are not high enough.  The \nRepublicans are unhappy about the exhorbitant amount of funds and the RPS \nthat are already in the bill, and are not willing to vote for an amended bill \nthat the Dems are pushing for.  The enviros and the unions are, as they have \nbeen for the last 6 months, the dividing force in this debate.\n\nTherefore, the proponents coalition moved their efforts to the Senate, with \nthe hope of getting a vote out this week and then move it back over to the \nHOuse.  While we had a good commitment from Senate leadership (both Dems and \nRepublicans) on Monday, that support has eroded as of this morning.  We are \ntrying a number of tactics, and hope that there will be some positive \nmovement today and tomorrow.  Without the Governor stepping up to the plate \nand \"encouraging\" the democrats to gather the number of democrat votes \nneccessary this week, I am not optimistic about passage.\n\nThere are still two-three weeks of session left, so this debate could rage \nuntil then, but my sense is that if we don't get something out of the Senate \nby the end of this week or early next week, we'll be dead.  Call if you have \nany questions.\n#612-339-4599\n\n\n\n\n"

Certainly, it  is difficult at this \npoint to project how much backbone capacity will be  subscribed, and at what \ncost.? However, it is a fact that every end user on  the SoCalGas system will \nneed to acquire and pay for backbone capacity in order  to move gas to their \nfacility.? Lad and Gillian made, in my view, a  reasonable estimate that, on \naverage, end users would pay $0.07 per Dth for  backbone service, based on \ntotal backbone costs divided by BCAP  throughput.? Some may use interruptible \nservice and pay 120% of this rate;  others may obtain backbone service at a \ndiscount.? On average, Lad and  Gillian's numbers are a reasonable projection \nand very defensible.?  Moreover, in my view, we need to try to seize the high \nground on the issue of  rate impacts on EGs; otherwise SCGC?will do so, \nand?our settlement  could face a real problem.\n?\nTom Beach\n - EG Testimony.doc"

Lad and Gillian made, in my view, a reasonable\n> estimate that, on average, end users would pay $0.07 per Dth for backbone\n> service, based on total backbone costs divided by BCAP throughput.  Some\n> may use interruptible service and pay 120% of this rate; others may obtain\n> backbone service at a discount.  On average, Lad and Gillian's numbers are\n> a reasonable projection and very defensible.  Moreover, in my view, we\n> need to try to seize the high ground on the issue of rate impacts on EGs;\n> otherwise SCGC will do so, and our settlement could face a real problem.\n>\n> Tom Beach << File: EG Testimony.doc >> "

SoCal filed a protest and I'm working on the response.  In \npart, they are alleging that TW is \"attempting to exploit a weakness\" in the \nGISB procedures to the detriment of existing customers.  For example, under \nTW's tariff (which they concede is GISB compliant), primary firm cannot bump \nalt. firm in cycle 2.  SoCal says this means that any primary shipper \nattempting to deliever to an in-path alt. point will be unable to re-nominate \nto its primary point once this \"alternate\" capacity [I assume they mean \nUSGT's] is confirmed.  According to SoCal this will substantially limit \nshippers' flexibility, including the ability to use market area pooling.  \nOnce gas is nominated thru a pool its subsequent movement to a delivery point \nis defined as an al. delivery regardless of the rights of the capacity under \nwhich it moves.  Thus by manipulating the GISB cycle process, TW and USGT \nwill bump firm shippers.\n\nI could really use your help in responding to this argument.  (First of all, \nI'm not sure I even understand it!)  If either of you have a few minutes \ntoday or tomorrow when we could get together, that would be great.  Also -- \nyou two were the first to come to mind, but feel free to refer me to someone \nelse in your group if you are swamped.

I \nagree with you that the mass- market retail parties should also include \ncomplementary testimony.? Although we discussed this earlier, I did not \nreceive any firm commitments from the retail folks that they would sponsor \nsuch testimony - it may be an oversight on my part.? Nonetheless, retail \ntestimony by those in the market should include a discussion of the benefits \nfrom Greenmountain.com, Utility.com, CUB, REMAC and the others.? Might I \nsuggest that Enron, as a large mass-marketer itself, coordinate this effort \nwith the other retail partners ? \n\nIn addition, I want all settlement parties to look beyond testimony to the \nhearings, which are scheduled to begin in little more than a month.? We will \nneed to make some time available during late May for practice panels \n(assuming we are granted panel hearings) and individual practice \ncross-examination.? At the same time, we also need to start thinking about \ndirect cross-examination of the SCGC/TURN parties (again, assuming we decide \nto engage in full cross-examination of their settlement).? There is merit to \ncross-examination of the opposing settlement since it is not very well \nthought out, results in substantial cost-shifts, and is not consistent with \nthe Commission's most promising options.? On the other hand, there is merit \nto limiting our cross, especially of Florio, who will use the witness box to \ngrandstand.?

While she \nmay offer additional guidance at the PHC on April 24, we need to start the \nprocess of formalizing the testimony supporting the Comprehensive Settlement \nAgreement.? \n? \nWe have already identified the content and parties responsible for drafting \nthe testimony (as identified below).? The testimony will be based on a \"hub \nand spoke\" approach, where SoCalGas will focus on the mechanics of \nunbundling, describing in detail how the capacity and retail unbundling \nprocess will work, with other parties filing testimony that complements \nSoCalGas' testimony while offering the parties individual perspective on why \nthe settlement is in the public interest and benefits customers, the state \nof California, mom and apple pie - you get the picture.? In addition, I \nwould like to suggest the following deadlines for getting testimony prepared \nand circulated so that all of the signatories to the settlement agreement \nhave an opportunity to review and comment appropriately on the drafts.? I \nsuggest we adhere to the following schedule: \n? \nApril 25? Draft Outlines of Testimony? (Optional) \nApril 28? 1st Draft Testimony \nMay 2??? 2nd Draft Testimony \nMay 5??? File Testimony w/Commission?????? \n? \nI think that it is essential that we circulate the draft testimony twice so \nthat everyone knows what will be filed on the May 5.? The schedule is \ncompressed, but we have to operate within the time parameters we've been \ngiven.?? The testimony assignments are identified below.? There has been one \nchange from what we had agreed to previously.? SoCalGas will sponsor a \nwitness on the \"Concepts of Unbundling\".? I would also like to suggest that \nwe file the testimony a one comprehensive document.?? I have suggested a \nchapter-style format that might work, but I am open to suggestion.? Let me \nknow what you think. \n? \n? \nChapter 1??? SoCalGas??????????????????????? Concepts of Unbundling \n\nChapter 2??? SoCalGas???????????????????????

          "body": "By now, most of you have heard about the FirstEnergy Settlement, underwhich \nFE will recover as best we can ascertain at this time, all of its stranded \ncosts.  Key components of the setllement include:\n\n1. FE makes 1120 mw of power available at a price that varies by customer \nclass and increases gradually over the 5 years.  (The price does not include \nline losses which the Company agreed to throw in if another marketer signs on \n- none did),  The market price is also the shopping credit.  The  shopping \nincentive is then added to the credit . The shopping credit for residential \nand commercial customers is low but could possibly work pending analysis from \nstructuring.  The industrial credit is very low.\n\n2. Customers on special contracts (approximately 800 of them), can during the \nfirst year either opt to cancel their contract or extend it through the RTC \nrecovery period, which is unlawful in my view, although that observation did \nnot slow anyone down.\n\n3.  The settlement creates an implicit cap on shopping of 20% since the \nCompany will seek to have the incentive removed once the 20% is reached.  The \nagreement states that if the incentive is not removed, then customers will \npay for the incentive as a deferral which will extend the recovery period.  \nThis too is also unlawful because it allows the recovery of generation \nrelated costs beyond the market development period.\n\n4.  Barring extension of the shopping incentive and other caveats, the RTC \nrolls off on December 31, 2006 for Ohio Edison, June 30th, 2007 for Toledo \nEdison and December 31, 2008 for Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company.\n\n5.  Distribution rates are frozen until 2007.\n\n6. There is a 5% residential rate cut.\n\n7. FE absorbs the pancaking charges for power coming through PJM and MISO \nuntil the RTO is up and running.\n\nThis settlement is basically political.  Over the past several weeks, FE has \ncut a host of sidebar deals with each of the intervenors and customers who \nsigned on to this travesty.  When the parties were assembled for settlement \ntalks, they lasted 2 days before parties surrendered their litigation \npositions.  The hearing schedule is equally aggregious.  Coincidentally, the \nhearing examiners had a schedule in mind that was extremely similar to FE.  \nOur testimony is due on April 24 with no further discovery prior to its \nfiling.  The testimony of FE and defenders of the Stip is due on April 26.  \nWe then have 3 days for depositions with supplemental or rebuttal testimony \nbeing a big IF.  The hearing commences May 2.\n\nThe parties who thought it was fine to give FE $8.9 billion without \nquantification or review are Consumers Counsel, Staff, Industrial Users, \nRetail Merchants, Low income (some), Ohio Manufacturers, Shell Energy, \nKroger, AK Steel, Ohio Hospital Association.\n\nThose fighting the stipulation are all the other marketers, the Cleveland \nGrowth Association, the City of Cleveland, Citizens Action, Citizens Power,  \nSafe Energy Communications Council.\n\nBy separate e-mail, Laurie Knight will send you the shopping credit and \nshopping incentive numbers.  Also, if you would like a copy of the \nsettlement, please let Laurie know.\n\nTwo final points.  We are doing everything we can to try to improve or derail \nacceptance of the settlement, although it appears to be a fait accompli.  \nSecond, the stage has been set for similar type negotiations with the other \nutilities\n\nPlease pass this memo along to anyone else who you think has an interest in \nknowing this information.\n\nThanks,\nJanine   \n"

          "subject": "Testimony to Support the SoCalGas Settlement Agreement",
          "body": "To the Core Aggregator Group:\n\nAs you know, SoCalGas filed its formal gas industry restructuring settlement\nagreement with the CPUC yesterday (April 17).  Over the past two weeks, the\ncore aggregator group worked extensively with SoCalGas and the other\nsettlement parties to make sure that the settlement language tracked the\nagreed upon principles that were included in the \"term sheet\"  that was\nfiled with the CPUC on April 3.  Based upon my review of the document, I\nbelieve that the settlement agreement fairly reflects the deal that we\nreached with SoCalGas.\n\nThe CPUC's Presiding Judge in the case - - Andrea Biren - - has established\nthe procedural schedule for an evidentiary hearing in this proceeding.\nUnder this schedule, prepared direct testimony (in support of the\nsettlement) is due to be submitted by May 5.  Rebuttal testimony (opposing\nthe competing settlement that was filed by SCGC and TURN) is due to be\nsubmitted by May 19.  The hearing will begin on May 30.\n\nIn discussions with SoCalGas and the other settlement parties, it was agreed\nthat all of the industry groups that have participated in the SoCalGas\nsettlement should present testimony in support of the settlement.  This\nmeans that the core aggregator group (or individual members of the group)\nshould present one or more witnesses who can testify to the benefits that\nthe settlement will provide to the core aggregation program.  This effort\nmust commence immediately in order to achieve a May 5 deadline.\n\nI believe that it would be efficient for the core aggregator group (SPURR,\nREMAC, CUB, Greenmountain.com, utility.com, United Gas, Enron, TXU, Shell\nEnergy Services) to jointly sponsor a single witness to testify concerning\nall the benefits of the settlement for the core aggregation program.  This\ntestimony would address the following features:\n\n* Core interstate unbundling\n* Core storage unbundling\n* Unbundled (daily) balancing for core customers\n* Unbundled core backbone transmission\n* Avoided cost billing credits (and process to redetermine)\n* Core brokerage fee (and process to reconsider role of utility's core\nprocurement department)\n* Elimination of the cap on core customer participation in core\naggregation, and reduction of the threshold for core aggregation groups\n* Elimination of core subscription gas sales option\n\nIf a witness is to be engaged by the group, this will need to be done very\nsoon.  In addition, if the group wants to have one attorney\nrepresenting the group, this also should be decided very soon.\nAlternateively, individual core aggregators may prefer to proceed on their\nown.\n\nI estimate that the fees for an outside expert witness to testify on the\nabove-referenced matters would be approximately $9,900.  This\nestimate is based upon an hourly rate of $180.00, and an estimate of 55\nhours, as follows:\n\n  Activity\nHours\n\n Draft prepared testimony and      25\n (possibly) rebuttal testimony\n\n Prepare for hearings, including      20\n responses to discovery requests\n and mock cross-examination\n\n Hearing time        10\n ________________________\n_____\n\n      TOTAL:        55\nHours\n\n\nAt $180 per hour, the expert witness fees would be $9,900.  This does not\ninclude \"costs\".\n\nOur group should discuss, at the earliest possible time, how to proceed with\nthe presentation of prepared testimony.  Please respond\npromptly to this e-mail and provide your availability for a conference call\nwithin the next two days to discuss this matter.\n\nThank you for your attention to his request.\n\n- John Leslie\n\n\n\n\n**************\n\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nLuce, Forward, Hamilton & Scripps LLP\n600 West Broadway\nSuite 2600\nSan Diego, CA 92101-3391\n(619) 236-1414\n\nThe information contained in this electronic mail transmission is\nconfidential and intended to be sent only to the stated recipient of the\ntransmission.

          "body": "I reviewed the ECAR filing.  ECAR is requiring Enron to agree to use it as an \nECAR control area.  I generally think it is a good filing and of importance \nbecause it is one of the first times that any reliability requirement of a \nregion has been filed at FERC (ECAR asks FERC to balance commercial needs, \nreliability, equity, legal and policy objectives).  The compensation between \nECAR control areas is meant to discourage Cinergy-type stealing from the \ngrid.  It is mandatory for ECAR and ECAR invites other regions to \nparticipate.  \n\nInadvertant interchange (II) will be calculated over one hour.  The NERC \nperformance subcomm. will balance the II to establish long and short \nparties.  Based on a proportional allocation, the short party will pay the \nlong party its top incremental cost (highest purchase price or generation \nprice for power) + 10% penalty.  A $15/MW offset is used as the price of \npower repaid in kind to the interconnected system based on existing NERC \nsettlement procedures.  Price information is confidential.\n\nThe ECAR dispute resolution procedure is applicable (binding ADR is \nvoluntary).  Parties retain the right to go directly to FERC.\n\nLloyd -- Are you OK with the specifics?\n\nI do not see any reason to protest this.  EPSA wants to use the $15 offset to \nshow what may be reasonable for generator interconnects and I am discussing \nit with EPSA.  We should file a routine intervention (to obtain pleadings, \norders, etc.)  Interventions are due Friday, May 5.  \n\nAnyone disagree?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDave Mangskau@ENRON\n04/20/2000 04:58 PM\nTo: Christi L Nicolay/HOU/ECT@ECT\ncc: Charles Yeung/HOU/ECT@ECT, Greg Woulfe/HOU/ECT@ECT, Patrick \nHanse/HOU/ECT@ECT, Bill Rust/HOU/ECT@ECT, Lloyd Will/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard \nIngersoll/HOU/ECT@ECT, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON \nSubject: Re: ECAR filing  \n\nChristi:\nfor your info if you plan to file in support of this ECAR action, as Enron's \nrep to ECAR  I discussed this internally and have been supportive of a final \nproduct that includes sanctions.  Enron is not a voting member nor were we \ngiven an opportunity to make changes to the final document that went out for \nballot..........but it was similar to what was discussed in recent ECAR \nmeetings and was finalized after ECAR reps met with FERC staff to meet FERC \nconcerns.  \n\nIn addition, several weeks ago I presented the ECAR concept to the MAPP \nExecutive Committee and after discussion MAPP passed a resolution of support \nfor what ECAR was trying to accomplish to improve reliability.

The\nnumbers\nattached are from the previous draft and do not represent our most recent\nmodel\nruns.  We spent all of Friday, Saturday and part of Sunday reviewing numbers\nand\nare still updating and finalizing models as well as matching facts and\nfigures\npresented in the text to those assumed in the models.  We are going to spend\nthe\nfirst half of this week finishing (hopefully) the modelling process and\nputting\ntogether MD&A's for each investment.\n\nThis draft would have gone out yesterday, but we heard from the SoCal team\nin\nLondon that the format of each asset description had changed and wanted to\nat\nleast try to conform the NoCal draft to the altered format.  This is still\nin\nprocess at the writing of this E-Mail so that - in the interest of time - we\ndecided to get the text of the asset descriptions out now.  We understand\nthat\nthe new format is really just a reordering of the sections of each asset\ndescription so conforming NoCal to SoCal should be fairly straightforward.\n\nThe intro Regional Strategy piece is being rewritten by Frank Sayre/Frank\nStabler and myself and will be circulated on Wednesday or Thursday.\n\nIn the interest of those who have to download in remote locations, I am\nsending\nthe NoCal draft in multiple pieces.  A bound hard copy will be avilable\ntomorrow\nin Houston - let me know if you need one.\n\nI would request comments back no later than Friday morning (Houston time),\nso\nthat we can get them worked into the document over the weekend and have a\nfighting chance of being ready to send the document early next week.\n\nMany thanks,\n\nMLM\n---------------------- Forwarded by Michael Linn Miller/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on\n03/20/2000 06:38 PM ---------------------------\n\n\nRamzi.Nassar@msdw.com on 03/20/2000 03:13:35 PM\n\nTo:   michael.l.miller@enron.com\ncc:\n\nSubject:  NoCal March 20 Draft - Cover Page, Table of Contents, C/A, and\nTabs\n\n\n\n\n(See attached file: #143929 v1 - Nocal IM TOC - March 20.doc)\n\nThis document includes the structure into which all the following emails\nwill be\ninserted.\nEach email corresponds to on of the sections in the Table of Contents.\n\n(See attached file: #143929 v1 - Nocal IM TOC - March 20.doc)\n\n\n\n - #143929 v1 - Nocal IM TOC - March 20.doc"

As some of you \nmay have noticed in the trade press, there has started to be alot press \nreleases from the opponents and proponents of the bill.  The opponents are \nbringing out AARP and the Office of the Consumer Advocate, the proponents \n(that includes us) have been putting out positive  quotes from the School \nboards, the low income community action groups and the retail community.  \nRadio ads have started running in both the Des Moines area as well in \noutstate.  \n\nIt appears that floor debate will start next Monday, March 27th in the \nHouse.  It is widely anticipated that debate will go on for many days, with \nthe hope that the bill can get passed over to the Senate by April 3, so that \nthey can spend at least a week on the debate.\n\nThe Governor issued a statement that basically said that his office believed \nthat moving forward is a good thing, but that he was going to leave it up to \nthe legislators to either vote it up or down.  We believe that if the bill \ncomes out in substantially the same manner as it now sits, the Governor will \nsign it.  \n\nThere are still raging disagreements on the environmental pieces....Enron has \ntried to remain as neutral as possible on the renewables section due to our \nbusiness interests in Iowa with Enron Wind.  \n\nAs I have stated in earlier updates, this bill most likely will not pass \nuntil the last few days of the session, sometime in Mid April."

Ken Malloy, President of CAEM and primary author of the RED Index,\nhas been a public official with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,\nthe Illinois Commerce Commission, and the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\nIs there a correlation between states with higher electric prices and\nstates' progress toward restructuring?  There is a stronger movement in\nstates that rank higher in average price, since all contiguous states\nscoring in the top 10 for price also were in the top 20 in the RED Index.\nBut this movement is no confined to high priced states.  Nevada, Montana,\nand Texas all are below average states on price but are ranked in the top 10\non the RED Index.\n\nRED Index 2000 is a 90-page study that measures the progress states have\nmade in moving from the monopoly model of public utility regulation to the\ncompetitive model. A RED Index score of 0 represents the monopoly model and\na score of 100 represents complete and effective implementation of the\ncompetitive model. The index focuses on retail competition and currently\nonly covers electric restructuring, and will be updated twice a year.\n\nCAEM developed the RED Index by identifying 18 key attributes that are the\nfoundation for an effective transition to competition. These attributes were\nweighted and scores were assigned to the different options that states have\nregarding that attribute. CAEM then conducted research to determine the\noption chosen by each state on each of the 18 attributes. The index scores\nwere then calculated based on the methodology and research.\n\nCAEM provides the RED Index at no fee to state public utility commissions,\nstate energy offices, consumer organizations, governmental agencies,\neducational, and nonprofit, public interest organizations. CAEM funds the\nstudy by charging a fee of $495 to private sector companies.\n\nPrivate sector organizations can order a copy from redindex@caem.org,\nthrough the center website at www.caem.org, or by calling 703-250-1580.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me with any questions.\n\nKen Malloy\nPresident\nCenter for the Advancement of Energy Markets\n5765-F Burke Center Parkway (PMB333)\nBurke, VA 22015-2233\no 703-250-1580\nh 703-239-8862\nf  248-928-5040\ne kmalloy@caem.org\n\n[[ KENMAL~1.VCF : 4119 in winmail.dat ]]\n\n - winmail.dat"

In addition, we seek specific \nproposals as to how such an arrangement should be defined.\"\n\nAccordingly, the testimony we file should explain:\n\n1.  The unfair harm that could potentially befall TW customers if Hector Road \nwere established as a formal receipt point\n2.   Our proposal for making Hector a formal receipt point by establishing \nprimary and secondary receipt points\n3.  Why our proposal is fair and consistent with Commission policy (here we \nmight want to draw analogies to the interstate system and explain why that \nworks)\n\nI will also have an opportunity to make legal and policy arguments in a brief \nafter testimony has been filed.\n\nLet's discuss how best to go about drafting the testimony.  I think the best \nthing to do would be to outline the testimony, then decide who is going to \nsay what.  I'm available after about 2:00 today.\n "

          "body": "The CPUC is very aware that the utilities have gone to the legislature when \nthe UDCs face elimination of some of the advantages that they have in the \nretail market.  We now have a fully-constituted commission (5 members) with \ntwo new democratic appointees with close ties to the governor.  This may \nempower the CPUC to take control of issues within their purvue, which \nratemaking and the PX credit, clearly are.  Some members of the legislature \nare loathe to get into the CPUC's backyard and \"micro-manage\".  That being \nsaid, we still face significant risk within the legislature.  We have Steve \nPeace, who thinks a wholesale pass-through is adequate for competition, and \nRod Wright, the chair of the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee, who \nsponsored a similar bill last year and who doesn't believe in retail \ncompetition either.  We have our work cut out for us.\n\nLast year we fought essentially the same battle and defeated the utilities at \nattempts to include similar provisions into law for electricity.  We were \nable to do so because we had a broad coalition of supporters, including the \nenvironmental community.  Essentially, everyone opposed the utilities' \nproposals.\n\nThis year we have a different scenario.  SCE is attempting to peel off \nenvironmental groups by rolling in extension of the public purpose funding.  \nThey are also talking to the large consumers, who may perceive that they are \nable to get a better deal from the utilities by avoiding the mark-up.\n\nHowever, it doesn't appear as though the utilities are united in supporting \nSCE's language.  We are actively attempting to revive the coalition that was \nso effective last year.  We are talking to the environmental groups to try \nand keep them in the fold.  This can be done by keeping the two issues of \npublic purpose funding and competition as separate as possible.  \n\nWe have been encouraged to settle the PX credit case by the judge.  We are \nengaged in the beginning stages of settlement on the PX credit issue with \nSDG&E.  We are a long way from settling, however, if we are successful, the \nsettlement would likely be precedential for both SCE and PG&E.  There is \nsignificant room between the utility proposals for the \"retail\" portion of \nthe PX credit and what we are supporting.  We also appear to have the support \nof the ratepayer advocates.  We are attempting to get the customer groups to \nagree on an outcome, leaving the utilities isolated.  Adoption of our \nproposal for the full retail adder is a long-shot.\n\nFrom a timing perspective, it is possible that we will resolve this issue at \nthe PUC, before any legislation would become effective.  However, that would \nnot prevent the legislation from estopping the CPUC decision.\n\nWe could use the help of the business units in providing documented \ninformation about the UDCs activities, if its available.

Of course SCE does \nthis stuff under the guise of Customer Education.  Do we have anything in \nwriting provided by SCE that Enron Govt Affairs can provide to the CPUC as \nexamples of marketing activities, whereby the costs of these types of \nactivities should be unbundled from the distribution rate.\n\nOf course there is no mark--up what so ever, because the cost of providing \nretail commodity is recovered in distribution rates.  Enron Govt Affairs is \ncurrently participating in a proceeding as part of a coalition to determine \nwhat this commodity cost adder should be.\n\nAdditionally, the reason there is no premium mark-up for risk management is \nbecause these costs are all pass throughs so there is no price certainty for \nthe customer.  In fact, there will be price volatility from month-to-month, \nif not hour-to-hour.  We do not want to push this last point to much, to the \nextent that the customers rally at the CPUC to eliminate the volatility along \nwith the price signals in favor of interclass and intertemporal subsidies.\n\nRoger\n\n  \n\n\n\nKelly Cook\n02/29/2000 02:02 PM\nTo: Bruno Gaillard/SFO/EES@EES\ncc: Thomas S Reichelderfer/DUB/EES@EES, Jim Badum/HOU/EES@EES, Janel \nGuerrero/HOU/EES@EES, Lisa Mackey/SF/ECT@ECT, Jeff Brown/HOU/EES@EES, Douglas \nCondon/SFO/EES@EES, Martin Wenzel/SFO/HOU/EES@EES, Phyllis \nAnzalone/SFO/EES@EES, Roger Yang/SFO/EES@EES, Harry Kingerski/HOU/EES@EES, \nSusan J Mara/SFO/EES@EES, Jeff Dasovich/SFO/EES@EES, Mona L \nPetrochko/SFO/EES@EES, Sandra McCubbin/SFO/EES@EES, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT \nSubject: Re2: SCE Legislative Language  \n\nAs you would expect, SCE is out telling customers that the proposed \nlegislative language regarding default electric service is a done deal.

This language has not yet found a \nbill. However, in order to be prepared, Sandi McCubbin has asked me to \nforward the proposed  language for analysis. \n\nBellow is a preliminary analysis of the bill and of our position. Please \nexpand, edit and complete for legislative action. Please foward to \nappropreate people for comments.\n\nSummary:\n\nSCE is defining the basic electric service to include, Distribution, \nMetering, Billing, and Customer Service\n\nSCE believes that the UDC should be the default provider and offer commodity \nat a pass through PX price with no adders.\n\nEvery customer will be charged a non-bypassable charge for basic electric \nservice (customer charge) and a non-bypassable public goods charge (Energy \nefficiency, low income, R&D, and renewable charge). Renewable charge includes \nfunding for production credits for renewable not under contract with utility, \nmandatory state purchase of renewable energy, minimum utility content of \nrenewable energy, PX green product, Customer credit for Renewables not under \ncontract with the utility.\n\nDA customers can choose billing and metering services from their ESP and will \nreceive an avoided cost credit from the UDC for these services.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nSCE is trying to preempt through the legislation the role of the utility to \nbe a Wires and Revenue Cycle Services (RCS) company. Furthermore they see \nthemselves as being a default provider and offer electric commodity at the \nwholesale price, undermining any kind of competition from ESPs.\n\nTheir definition of what is included in the renewable credit again undermines \nany competition for ESPs in offering these products.\n\nFurthermore, although SCE allows ESPs to offer metering and billing services, \nthe credit ESPs can receive is based on an avoided cost. The CPUC is \ncurrently presiding over a proceeding, in which it is trying to unbundle RCS. \nAt a minimum the credits for billing and metering services should be based on \nLong Run Marginal Costs.\n\nPosition: Actively Oppose\n\nThe UDC should be a wires only company. For a UDC, Basic Electric Service \nshould only include the distribution of the electric power and should be \nrenamed as Basic Electric Distribution Service. Revenue Cycle Services \n(metering, billing,..) should be unbundled from the distribution function. \nCosts allocated to these functions should be based, at a minimum, on a Long \nRun Marginal Costs or Embedded Costs. The Avoided Costs allocation does not \nrepresent all the costs associated with these services. \n\nThe default provider function should be competitively bid out to ESPs and \nnon-regulated affiliates. The UDCs should be out of the energy service \nbusiness including all electric retail functions. The commodity charge for \ndefault customers should include the PX price, all procurement related costs, \nand retail marketing related costs. \n   \nCurrently, the green market is the only viable market in CA for small \nconsumers.  This proposal would eliminate the competitive market and ensure \nmarket-share dominance for UDC and PX. \n\nSCE's proposal would limit, or seriously restrict, the development of the \nmarket to only UDC-provided green products of PX-provided green products.  \nThis structure creates a subsidy for both the UDCs and the PX for green \nproducts, which would disadvantage competitive offerings for the amount under \ncontract, providing the UDC with a guaranteed base-load of green-product \ndemand.  The market available to competitors for green would be only the \ndemand in excess of the base, for which customers (not ESPs) would receive a \ncredit from the UDC for the incremental green demand.  Again, because the UDC \nwould be in the position of doling out credits for green, they would still \ncontrol that market.\n\nAttached is a copy of SCE's draft language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

          "body": " May 17, 2000\n\n\nVia Internet\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTO: Interested Clients\n\nFROM: John & Hengerer\n\nRE: Commission Meeting -- May 17, 2000\n\nAt today's meeting, the Commissioners approved the consent agenda and then \ndiscussed the following items.  \n\n ELECTRIC MATTERS\nAlliance Companies, et al., Docket Nos. ER99-3144\nIn December 1999, the Commission issued an order conditionally authorizing \nthe formation of the Alliance RTO.  At today's meeting, the Commissioners \ndenied (by a margin of 3 to 1, Commissioner Hebert dissenting) rehearing of \nthe December 1999 order.  The Commissioners also unanimously rejected \n(Commissioner Massey concurring) Alliance's compliance filing.\n\nIn its original filing, Alliance proposed allowing each of its 5 active \nowners to retain up to a 5 percent ownership interest in the RTO (up to 25 \npercent total ownership by active owners).  The December 1999 order rejected \nthis proposal as contrary to the independence principle outlined in Order No. \n2000, which states that active ownership should be limited to a total of 15 \npercent unless special circumstances are shown.  Rejecting requests for \nrehearing, the majority concluded that Alliance had failed to justify active \nmember ownership in excess of 15 percent.  Dissenting, Commissioner Hebert \nargued that (i) the 15 percent benchmark is arbitrary and should not be \nviewed as creating a binding legal requirement. and (ii) limiting active \nownership will provide a disincentive for other utilities to join the RTO.\n\n\n3\n\nThe Commissioners also rejected Alliance's compliance filing submitted to \nsatisfy the terms of the December 1999 order.  In addition to failing to \ncorrect the active ownership issue outlined above, the Commissioners faulted \nAlliance for not eliminating pancaked rates and for not addressing issues \nassociated with the RTO's scope and configuration.  Commissioner Massey \nindicated that he would write a concurrence to stress that Aseams@ agreements \ndo not negate the need to review the RTO's scope and configuration to ensure \nthat it is properly designed and sized. \n\nSouthwest Power Pool, Docket No. EL00-39\nThe Commissioners unanimously rejected, as failing to meet the requirements \nof Order No. 2000, the Southwest Power Pool's (SPP) RTO proposal.  \nCommissioner Massey, who moved the item to the discussion agenda, cited the \nfollowing shortcomings in SPP's proposal: (i) operational control of \ntransmission facilities was not turned over to the RTO; (ii) the RTO's \nproposed open-access transmission tariff did not comply with Order No. 2000; \n(iii) no real-time balancing market had been proposed; (iv) lingering \nconcerns with the RTO's governance structure; and (v) the RTO's proposed \nscope and configuration are inadequate.  Commissioner Massey encouraged the \nSPP to join other entities seeking to form an RTO, or consider merging with \nthe Midwest ISO. \n\nNotice of Interim Procedures to Support Reliability and Request for Comments, \nDocket No. EL00-75\nThe Commissioners unanimously approved short-term procedures designed to \naddress Summer 2000 reliability concerns.  The approved measures provide for \n(i) streamlining FERC procedures to promote on-site, distributed generation, \n(ii) waiving prior-notice requirements for load-reduction agreements, (iii) \nimproving demand-side price signals, (iv) requiring more extensive OASIS \nposting of available transmission capacity; and (v) making Commission Staff \nmore available to the industry to address reliability concerns.  Comments on \nthe proposed short-term measures are due by June 2, 2000.  \n\nAdditionally, agreeing that the short-term procedures are very minimal in \nnature, the Commissioners requested comments on long-term reliability \nissues.  Comments are due by June 30, 2000.\nFinally, Commissioner Hebert indicated that he would write a separate \nconcurrence to express his belief that competitive forces are the answer to \nreliability concerns and to criticize the Commission for not eliminating \nartificial price caps and promoting competitive rates.  Commissioner Hebert's \naccusation that the Commission was more concerned with politics than good \npolicy touched off a heated debate, with Chairman Hoecker reciting FERC \nsuccesses and Commissioner Massey scoffing at Commissioner Hebert's \nsuggestion that price caps were to blame for generation shortages. \n\n\n\n GAS MATTERS\nRegulation of Short-Term Natural Gas Transportation Services, Regulation of \nInterstate Natural Gas Transportation Services, Docket Nos. RM98-10, RM98-12\nThe Commissioners unanimously addressed and generally denied requests for \nrehearing of Order No. 637.  Finding that Order No. 637 strikes a good \nbalance between competing interests, the Commissioners indicated that their \norder would, with several exceptions, uphold the mandates of the order.  The \nCommissioners expressly noted that requests for rehearing of \nright-of-first-refusal (ROFR) roll-up issues would be denied. Order No. 637 \nstates that, if a pipeline is fully subscribed, a party wishing to exercise a \nROFR will be required to match competing bids, even if a competing bid \nexceeds the maximum rate for the capacity.  \n\nRevisions and clarifications of Order No. 637 approved by the Commissioners \nat today's meeting include:\n(1) shippers with multi-year contracts at max rates for seasonal service will \nretain their ROFR;\n(2) pipelines will be required to post available capacity within one hour of \neach nomination cycle, rather than within one day as directed by Order 637;\n(3) short-term capacity release transactions must be posted within one hour \nof the first nomination under the contract, rather than upon the execution of \nthe contract as stated in Order No. 637; and\n(4) Order No. 637's OFO penalty and imbalance provisions will be clarified in \nthe Commission order.\n\nAlthough comments at today's meeting were brief, we anticipate a lengthy \norder addressing the numerous issues raised by parties in their requests for \nrehearing."

We have until Friday, April 28th, \n3:00p.m. EST to offer our legal technical changes.  If you can return your \ncomments to me (hand-written comments on the document itself are fine), I \nwill communicate them directly to the Senators' offices.    \n\nWE MUST KEEP THIS DOCUMENT COMPLETELY CONFIDENTIAL FOR OUR INTERNAL USE \nONLY.  WE SHOULD NOT COMMENT TO PRESS OR OTHERS THAT WE KNOW THE DOCUMENT \nEXISTS, NOR SHOULD WE DISCUSS THAT WE ASSISTED IN ITS WRITING.  THE POLITICS \nREQUIRE THIS COURSE OF ACTION.\n\nNext week, after the bill is introduced, I recommend we make public comment \nin support of the legislation as it continues to move the process forward \ntowards bill enactment this Congress.\n\nThe bill contains a date certain of 1/1/2002; stranded cost recovery \nlanguage; PURPA 210 repeal, the bundled FERC authority for interstate \ntransmission and reliability plus the non-discrimination language we \nsuccessfully lobbied for and about which Congressman Barton is already aware \nof Senator Gramm's support for Enron's position, PUHCA repeal, environmental \nconditionality and tax provisions for publics, coop's and nuclear \ndecommissioning.  Although we successfully drafted and communicated our \ntransmission language to the Senators, their attorneys have made language \nadjustments (pride of authorship) which our attorneys should confirm have not \ncaused material defect.  If so, we can suggest drafting changes by this \nFriday.\n\nAll the language you have has been agreed to by both Senators.  The section \nmissing, the environmental provision, is the last section the two men will \nwork out this week and will be essential to final bill passage.  Their goal \nremains addressing the grandfathered coal facilities and their disagreements \nare technical in nature.  Namely:  do you disqualify pre-1971 constructed \ncoal facilities at a percentage responsible for a percentage of emissions (a \nRepublican approach) or do you qualify facilities which can operate ( a \nregulatory approach favored by the Democrats)?  With the Bush/Gore \nPresidential race in full swing, this issue brings ramifications and politics \nto bear at the highest level.\n\nAs a further update on this issue:  tomorrow the Senate holds a hearing on \nthis issue with all four of the FERC Commissioners testifying, the \nMid-American group and the DOE Pro-Competition Stakeholder group are meeting \nwith each other to gain further consensus, plus both are meeting with NARUC's \nChuck Grey and Chris Mele to seek consensus.  I will attend all these \nmeetings for Enron and report back our continued progress.  Further, we are \nscheduling Dr. Tabors and Enron's Bob Schultz for a Congressional Hill \nbriefing next week to discuss Dr. Tabors' research on the price spike as \nproof Congress must make structural changes to the interstate rules plus \ndemonstrate Enron On-Line's ability to show market price inefficiency.  \nFinally, we will participate in a \"team drafting\" exercise with MidAmerican \non their compromise right of first refusal transmission language with Dan \nWatkiss as our representative, with others represented by Bill Sherman, Besty \nMoler and Randy Davis.  This is an effort to include the Bennett Johnston ACE \ngroup into the MidAmerican fold.  We did get MidAmerican to add the \nseparation of market and transmission function language in the context of the \nRTO language.\n\nMuch progress continues even though the House is not in session this week.  \nThe month of May will provide opportunities for Enron to continue \nintensifying our legislative efforts.  To date, the strategy we at Enron laid \nout months ago is playing out with the two tracks of consensus and \nreliability crisis both receiving traction.  We just need the dominoes we \nsuccessfully laid out the strategy for months ago to continue falling.\n\nPlease feel free to call me should you need additional information or have \nany questions.\n"

          "body": "TVA and Entergy filed answers to the numerous protests to Entergy's source \nand sink filing.\n\nTVA responded specifically to Enron and VEPCO's filings basically stating \nthat the NERC letter was limited to the TVA/Enron dispute and inapplicable to \nthe Entergy issue.  TVA also made accusations that Enron in effect secretly \ntalked with NERC to get a task force made up of members \"predisposed to \nEnron's point of view.\"  TVA said that the task force ignored TVA's requests \nto meet with it and that the task force went beyond current NERC policy.  \nFinally, TVA understands that \"Enron has prevented SERC\" from bringing the \nmatter to NERC ADR.\n\nEntergy's answer largely cites past FERC orders that approved the source and \nsink on tags (and denied Enron's Capacity Reservation Tariff) and basically \nstates that the protests are a collateral attack on Order No. 888 (as we have \nknown, the OATT does require ultimate source and sink on firm and allows them \non non-firm).  Entergy's filing, however, is lacking in substantive reasons \nwhy reliability would be so much better served by requiring this at the \nreservation level, when NERC has stated it is not necessary for reliability \nuntil the 20/30 minute ahead tag.  Entergy says it can do a better job of \nlisting actual ATCs and will prevent Entergy from overselling its system \n(although since Entergy's ATCs are usually low or 0 coming in over the ties, \nI question how many times Entergy has oversold Firm transmission.)  Entergy \nalso states that it and the Security Coordinators can police the IDC tags, in \ncase the marketer puts the wrong priority information on the tag (how often \ndoes this happen?).  [[I also don't know how Entergy is going to have time to \ncheck all this, when we called FERC hotline on them last year for lack of \ntimely responses to reservation and tags]].  Although the IDC does not even \nanalyze specific bus bars (and generator source and sink are optional on the \ntags now), Entergy says this is \"irrelevant\", but TLRs will be improved.\n\nEntergy cites FERC's 1998 OASIS orders that \"EPSA has not made a compelling \nargument that disclosure would harm liquidity.\"  I think that the compelling \narguments are being made now about the discrimination.  Although FERC \napproved the source and sink, transmission providers have not been using them \nand the tags don't require them.\n\nEntergy notes that when FERC issued the OASIS order, specific bus bar \ninformation was required on the tag -- now it is optional on the tag.  Even \nso, Entergy states that requiring it on the reservation does not make it \ninconsistent with the tag.  (I disagree.)\n\nFinally, Entergy says that we can always put in \"anticipated\" source and \nsink, but if it changes, our priority may change.  It is my understanding \nthat even the smallest change in source and sink will make some change in the \npower flows, so you effectively would always go to the lowest priority.\n\nWe are considering filing a response that states the lack of evidence on the \nreliability issues when NERC doesn't think this is required is a material \nissue of fact that should be set for hearing, at least.\n\n"

We are proceeding with the kick-off of the permit amendment, and will be \nusing a combination of both the MCN and Calumet N2 unit data.  Per my phone \nmessage, it will take about a week or two to prepare the amendment at a cost \nup to $10,000 US, and then eight weeks to get the amendment.  We should be \nable to commence site work without the amendment, to the point of completing \nfoundations, based on previous discussions with the Municipality, County and \nOntario Ministry of Envir..\nEven though this work is not in our $35 MM US original DASH budget, we are \nplanning to proceed with this unless you've got a problem with it.\n2.  NEPCO have preliminarily re-worked the schedule now on the N1 \ndisassembly, move and install, and the N2 installation.  They believe they \nneed to get on site by the third week in June to begin site clearing in order \nto initiate foundation work by mid July.  Between June 15 and July 15 they \nwould do the foundation design - this should be on the generous side given \nthat we had done some foundation design last fall, and with MCN at least have \nsome of the N2 foundation work already done by ABB.\nWhether it's June 21 or 30 to start the site clearing, the schedule is \ngetting tight.\n\nRe capital cost estimate:\n3.  NEPCO is able to complete the revised capital cost estimate on the N1/N2 \ncase by June 9th at the latest (they're looking at moving it up to the 5th or \n6th if they work the weekend).  They have a problem at the moment as they are \nmoving offices over this weekend and will lose about 4 days.  They will have \na revised estimate on the N1 case by the end of next week - it looks today \nlike the cost savings for no acceleration and winter work and being able to \nbarge the units versus railing them, will all be worth at least $2 MM US. \nI'm assuming we would take the capital costs estimate into our DASH as soon \nas the estimate is ready and go for approval, so that we can meet schedule - \nI'm not sure where you stand on the \"roll-up\" approval on Moore, Pastoria and \nLas Vegas if the latter two don't go into Genco.\nMeanwhile, progress through RAC on the DASH continues.\n\nRe N2 units:\n4.  We continue to sort out whether the Calumet units might work from a noise \nand water perspective.  We still haven't seen the MCN/Columbus counter on the \nother units but they claim it's coming.\n\n"

Discussion with GE at sufficiently high level to determine whether any GE \nunits at any sites have ever made <9 ppm NOx with CO <25 ppm (M. Dobler has \ninitiated this discussion with Michelle April of GE).\n2.  A detailed plan of attack from GE to get the units within guarantee \nemission limits.\n3.  Resolution of the HMI sluggish response issue complete with a plan of \nattack.  The units can be run, but are clearly not ready for commercial \noperation with the sluggish HMI.\n\nWheatland:\n1.  A plan of attack from Westinghouse to correct the fuel valves (and/or \nnozzles) on units 1 and 2.  Currently, the units can not be run reliably at \nbase load.\n2.  Plan of attack and schedule to correct the vibrations on 1 & 2.\n3.  A response from Westinghouse and PCD to get dedicated TD and controls \nsupport (this comment also applies to Gleason); sharing Rutledge and PCD \ncontrols personnel is proving inadequate.\n4.  Frequent technical questions for Westinghouse are taking extended time to \nget answers.  A dedicated EE&CC or NEPCO representative in the Orlando office \nwould help facilitate getting rapid answers (applies to Gleason also).\n\nGleason:\n1.  A detailed schedule and plan of attack is needed for the compressor blade \nmodifications on units 1&2.\n2.  An on-site EE&CC representative is required to bird-dog the compressor \nblade seals modification.\n3.  Verification from Westinghouse that the 12 day modification will not slip \ninto 3 weeks is required (see item 1).\n4.  Verification that the IGV's have been fully corrected is required.\n5.

We discussed the \nopportunities for a generation project in the Albuquerque region and he \noffered the following observations.\n\n First, he indicated ENA has evaluated numerous projects in that area \nincluding participation in the Cobisa project. They always come to the same \nconclusion which is that the project economics become non-workable due power \ngrid constraints and the inability to negotiate a long-term wheeling \narrangement with PNM. He felt like the only reason Cobisa could go forward \nwas due to PNM being the purchaser of power from the project. \n\n We talked about lower the delivered cost of gas to the facility through a \n\"zero return\" pipeline but in the end what the generation facility would have \nto compete with is power from and around Palo Verde. He is very familiar with \nthe ENA model (in fact he could calculate various electric costs immediately \njust based on some parameters I mentioned to him over the phone). In the end, \nhe felt like ENA would not want to participate because the risk of having to \nsell the excess power at a competitive rate was just too great given the cost \nto get it to a market.\n\n We will continue to give the Pueblo project a final look by talking to \nPlains and Four Corners but without the baseload generation the pipeline \nprospects look pretty dismal.        \n\n"

Attached is a table that sets forth the monthly \nquantities and our indicative pricing (will be refreshing pricing based on \nupdated forwards).  They have decided not to go with the purchase for Jul-Aug \nat this time.  They seem to have gotten their act a little better together \nthis time around with pre-approvals internally, but any deal they do would \nstill need to be approved by the NHPUC.\n\nHere's the scoop on timeline:\n\nThey will send to us a draft contract this Friday for review/comment.  We \nneed to have our comments back to them by Weds Apr 5th.  Elizabeth, does this \nfit your schedule OK?\nThey plan to hold negotiations with us and other parties via phone on Monday \nApr 10th, and hope to close  a deal that same day.  Again, this deal would be \nsubject to NHPUC approval, so we need to get a feel for the risk of NHPUC \ndisapproval.\nTracy - as you know, they are not so attractive from a credit standpoint.   \nIs letter of credit sufficient in their case?  Can we talk about what we need \nto put in place for the transaction.\n\nI will be in Houston on Weds-Fri of this week (Elizabeth and Tracy -- I'll be \nsure to swing by and introduce myself).

          "body": "Hi folks:\n Very glad to hear about the new developments. Just to recap what we \ndiscussed this morning about different things you need to look into to set up \ntrading operations and the contacts:\n\n1. Licence to trade: Regulatory people: I guess you know about this part \nbetter than me.\n\n2. Trading & Risk Mgmt: Global Risk Mgmt oversight: John Sherrif in London \nhas the overall responsibility outside Western Hemisphere. Research group can \nhelp with the structuring models used for trading.\n\n3. Risk Conrols: Before trading group is operational, it needs to get the \nauthorization from the Board of Directors of Enron along with total position \nlimits and possibly value@risk limits. These limits are typically by \ncommodity type and by region. Risk Assessment & Control (RAC) under Rick Buy \nperforms the internal control function ensuring that the businesses adhere to \nthese trading limits.  Ted Murphy is the VP in RAC overseeing the trading \noperations. The value@risk models come from the Research group, but \nday-to-day monitoring of the numbers is done by Ted's group. \n\n4. Credit Risk: A credit reserve number is computed for each deal (again, the \nmodels are created by Research) and is transferred to the credit group under \nBill Bradford (also in RAC). This is basically like buying insurance from the \ncorp. , so that if there is a couterparty default, the loss is covered by the \nreserve pool of the credit dept.\n\n5. Legal: The name I was given is Alan Aronowitz for legal help.\n\n6. Back Office: Initially can survive with Excel spreadsheets. You should \ncontact the IT though when the plans finalize to talk about systems. \n\nAustralia is the most recent place where we set up the trading operations. \nYou can talk to Paul Quilky, the trader there to talk about these issues \n(mention to him that Grant Masson in Research gave his name). \n\nBarry Pierce in London was incharge of back office at the begin there.\n I can coordinate for talking with people next week. Give me a call Monday if \npossible. I hadn't the time to search for the presentation stuff today. Will \ndo it next week.\n\nKrishna."

He said that he generally understands the logic of the deal but \nsimply\nwants the risk management discipine applied to analzing the position (a \nreiteration of what Rick Buy had said in our meeting today).  I would simply \nask Vince's team to take a quick look tommorow at valuing the ships as stand \nalone positions with a guess at the volatility based on historical price \nmovements.   This would\nbe much easier than the Rainbow option approach and would allow us to roughly \nlook at the value of the options on the other two ships.  In other words we \ncould look at two ship  long positions with some implied volatilities and \nalso estimate daily VARs on the ships as if they were mark to market \n(although I agree with David that we will not likely be able to mark the \nships because they will be treated as leases).\n\nJohn\n\n\nJohn\n---------------------- Forwarded by John Sherriff/LON/ECT on 22/05/2000 19:05 \n---------------------------\n\n\nJoe Gold\n22/05/2000 18:58\nTo: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT\ncc:  \n\nSubject: Exmar Purchase Decision\n\n\nJohn,\n\nAfter spending a few minutes with our shipping experts in the coal and oil \ngroups, I have a slightly different angle on the Exmar LNG vessel decision.  \nI would ideally like to spend the time to analyse this purchase as we do \npower and gas positions.  Unfortunately, we do not have that luxury and \nsometimes, in absence of true analytics, the most rudimentary measures can \nprovide the best decision tools.  Here is how we would make the decision:\n\n1)  Our shipping expert confirms that $140 million for a 135,000 ton ship \nrepresents a good price relative to new build costs over the last three years \nand that quotes have been trending up past that number recently.  He also \nconfirms that the current trough is the result of the default of several Far \nEast buyers and that new LNG orders and other ship building (cruise liners) \nhave reduced the over capacity.  His experience and historic analysis has \nsuggested that the pricing cycle for LNG ships lasts for a significant \nperiod.  New efficiency measures should reduce new build prices (and allow \nfor a lower trough), but not by an extreme amount versus the $140 million \ncost of this vessel.   \n\nPierre normally likes to roll time charters; however, this is difficult in an \nilliquid shipping market like LNG.  He would purchase this ship if the LNG \nshipping book were his to manage.  He estimates the ship could be sold in a \ndistressed sale for $110 million and could be potentially time chartered on a \nlong term basis at a value of up to $200 million.  \n\n2)  Our development teams in Spain, Italy and Turkey have been trying to \nsolve the big question - gas.  In each country, the key to developing a \nmerchant plant is securing gas flexibility or at least securing negotiating \nleverage with the monopoly gas supplier.  It is questionable whether or not \nthis decision will have an immediate impact on Arcos.  The plant's time line \nand the realities of the LNG supply market may require that we commit to Gas \nNatural before any source of 3 to 5 year gas can be secured.   The shear \nthreat of being able to bring spot or term LNG to these markets will improve \nour negotiating leverage and/or allow us to create flexibility.  Going \nforward, however, other potential plant opportunities in Spain, and elsewhere \nin the Med region, may have the capacity to utilise these vessels.   I think \nthat this flexibility is worth at least $25 million to me.\n\n3)  I would summarise:   Upside   $60 + $25 = $85 million\n     Downside           ($30) + $25 =             ($5)  million\n\nI would do it.\n\nI will leave the rest to you.\n\nJoe\n\n\n\n\n\n"

          "body": "Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week, arriving Monday \nmorning and returning to Houston on Friday.  The purpose of my visit is in \nregard to my Global Risk Management Operations role,   I believe that Rick \nCausey met with you regarding some operations support that Brent and I will \nprovide to Fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during \nthe assimilation of Michael Jordan, the JP Morgan staffer that Fernley has \nhired.  Brent and I will be working with Fernley next week to iron out the \ndetails of our support for Fernley during that transition period.  We will \nalso map out an Enron trading operations introduction  for Michael Jordan, \nwhich may involve a short stint for him in Houston.  My goal is to provide a \nstrong resource to Fernley during this transition period and to work with \nFernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to Michael \nin his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as \npossible.  \n\nAnother purpose for the trip is to spend some time with Fernley and his  \nbusiness controllers  to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we \nwould commit to for 2000.  I know that Barry and Richard Sage have many good \nideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all Enron \nlocations with trading operations.  My earlier trips to London this year were \nfocused solely on Helsinki, and did not allow time to positively focus on \nleveraging worldwide operations experience.  I value input from other trading \noperations professionals and I look forward to the ideas that can be \ngenerated in working with Barry, Richard and some of their direct reports.  \n\nI also contacted Tani Nath about my trip to see how I could support her as \nshe moves into her role in Global Products.  I have not heard  from Tani, but \nI understand from others that she will be in the Houston office next week.  \nIt will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip, but based on my commitments in \nHouston and Rick Causey's desire to move forward on providing trading \noperations support to Fernley, next week is the best for me to be in London.  \nI did meet with Tani for an hour when she was here week before last and \noffered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role \nover Global Products.  I trust that she will contact me for that support as \nneeded.  \n\nI have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while I am there to \ndiscuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your \nbusiness efforts in London.  I look forward to meeting with you next week.  \n\nThis trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are \nconducting at Joe Sutton's request.   By circumstance, as you know, we have \ntaken a look at Helsinki and subsequently Oslo and Frankfurt.  There will be \na similar review of Continental power, UK gas, UK power and global liquids.  \nThe review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of \nNorth American locations and some entities in the US in which Enron has a \nlarge ownership position.  It is likely that the continuation of this effort \nin London will occur in mid April.  \n\nCopies of the drafts of the findings for Oslo and Frankfurt were provided to \nFernley as soon as the team returned to Houston.  We hope to finalise those \ndrafts this week as we receive comments from Fernley and the business \nmanagers in Oslo and Frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided.  Fernley \nsuggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final \ncopies, so I will have those forwarded to you today.  The Sydney and \nSingapore trip was a lengthy one, as it also involved a last leg of the trip \nin London with regard to support for SIngapore.  The Houston team returned \nthe middle of last week and worked with AA on an early draft last Friday.  I \ncan also provide you with a draft of that report, the completion of which was \npending input from Bill Bradford early this week (he made the trip but was \nout of the office last week).  We did do a preliminary review of the Sydney \nand Singapore findings with Rick Causey and Rick Buy on Friday afternoon, to \naccommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week.  They \nunderstood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them.  \n\n "

          "body": "Rep. Greg Ganske yesterday introduced legislation to ban MTBE and promote \nethanol.  He will most certainly offer this proposal as an amendment to \nwhatever legislation comes before the House Commerce Committee for a \nmarkup.   \n\nAs there have been a number of controversial issues to consider in the \ndebate, the House Commerce and Senate Environment Commitees have both had \ndifficulty settling on dates for their respective mark-ups of RFG \nlegislation, but we do expect both to try to move forward in the coming \nmonths.\n\nA copy of the legislation and Rep. Ganske's press release is attached.\n\n - ganske_009.pdf\n\n\nNEWS RELEASE\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nMarch 16, 2000\n\nReps. Ganske and Shimkus Introduce Legislation to Ban MTBE and Promote Ethanol\n\nRepresentatives Greg Ganske (R-IA) and John Shimkus (R-IL)today introduced \nthe Clean Air and Water Preservation Act of 2000 to ban the gasoline additive \nmethyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and promote renewable ethanol.  They were \njoined on the bill by 21 other Members of\nCongress.\n\nMTBE and ethanol are added to gasoline to reduce harmful emissions. MTBE is \nresponsible for widespread groundwater contamination. Ethanol, however, is a \nclean, renewable additive that does not contaminate water.\n\n\"We do not have to chose between clean air and clean water.  With renewable \nethanol, not MTBE, we can have both,\" Ganske said.\n\n\"This bill clearly addresses the problem of MTBE contaminating water,\" Ganske \nsaid.  \"Not only does it eliminate MTBE in gasoline within three years, it \ndirects the EPA to help states figure out how to get this chemical out of \ntheir drinking water supplies.\"\n\n\"MTBE has caused the contamination of groundwater in sites around the \ncountry, including my District. However, there is a safe and clean \nalternative - ethanol,\" Shimkus said. \"The Clean Air and Water Preservation \nAct will provide cleaner air by reducing harmful auto emissions and will \nprovide cleaner water, as ethanol spillage does not contaminate\ngroundwater.\"\n\n\"The Clean Air and Water Preservation Act of 2000 gives refiners the \nflexibility they have sought within the Clean Air Act by allowing them to \naverage their oxygen content,\" Ganske said.  \"While giving them this \nflexibility, we have also raised the bar on environmental quality.\"\n\nThe Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 required specific reductions in harmful \nemissions.  With oxygenated fuels in the Reformulated Gasoline Program, \nrefiners have exceeded these requirements. The bill raises the standards to \ntake into consideration these lower emissions levels, resetting the bar at a \nmore environmentally sound level.\n\nIn promoting the bill, Ganske cited a USDA study of the agriculture impact of \nreplacing MTBE with ethanol.  The study found that doing so would generate an \nextra $1 billion in on-farm cash receipts each year.  In addition, it would \nimprove the price of corn by 14 cents per bushel each year for at least the \nnext ten years.\n\n\"The Clean Air and Water Preservation Act of 2000 is a sensible environmental \nand agricultural bill,\" Ganske said.  \"It is exceptionally important \nconsidering our farmers are entering their third year of depressed commodity \nprices and Congress last year appropriated billions in emergency farm \nsupport.\"\n\nThe Clean Air and Water Preservation Act of 2000 does the following:\n\n* Bans MTBE within three years and urges refiners to replace it with ethanol.\n* Requires labels be placed on all pumps dispensing MTBE-blended fuel.\n* Directs EPA to provide technical guidelines to help states remove MTBE from \nwater.\n* Gives refiners flexibility to blend oxygen within the 2% requirement.\n* Prohibits environmental backsliding by raising the standards on emissions \nreductions and prohibiting an increase in the use of gasoline aromatics \n(which can lead to cancer-causing particulate emissions).\n* Directs DOE and EPA to look for alternative sources of gasoline oxygenates.\n\n\n\"Congress must make a commitment to environmental quality, renewable energy \nand American agriculture.  This bill does all three,\"  Ganske said.  \"It will \nhelp cleanup MTBE contaminated water supplies.  It will preserve the clean \nair accomplishments of the past decade.  And it will provide a renewable \nenergy source which will decrease our dependence on foreign oil and improve \nour agricultural economy.  The Clean Air and Water Preservation\nAct of 2000 is a good bill for all involved.\"\n\nOriginal Cosponsors:\n> John Shimkus (IL)\n> Bill Barrett (NE)\n> Lane Evans (IL)\n> Jim Leach (IA)\n> Leonard Boswell (IA)\n> Tom Latham (IA)\n> David Minge (MN)\n> Ray LaHood (IL)\n> Jim Ramstad (MN)\n> Lee Terry (NE)\n> David Phelps (IL)\n> William Lipinski (IL)\n> Jerry Weller (IL)\n> Roy Blunt (MO)\n> Pat Danner (MO)\n> Thomas Ewing (IL)\n> Kenny Hulshof (MO)\n> Fred Upton (MI)\n> John Thune (SD)\n> Bruce Vento (MN)\n> Sherwood Boehlert (NY)\n> Don Manzullo (IL)\n"

Benton, CQ Staff \nAt the dawn of the year, it seemed Congress would be content to let the \ncurrent session end without moving legislation to encourage further \nderegulation of the nation's $220 billion <electric> market. But developments \nin the past few weeks suggest that groups interested in seeing deregulation, \nas well as the Clinton administration, are building a consensus that will put \npressure on Congress to move some kind of bill this year.\nOn April 6, a group called the <Electricity> Restructuring Stakeholders -- \nrepresenting consumers, <electric> generating companies, senior citizens and \nothers -- released a set of goals they believe should be included in \nrestructuring legislation. The principles include repeal of the Public \nUtility Holding Company Act of 1935 (<PUHCA>) and changes to a 1978 law (PL \n95-617) that required state utility commissions and <utilities> to reform \ntheir <electric> rates and take other measures to even out daily <electric> \nconsumption. (1978 CQ Almanac, p. 639)\nThe group plans to meet with environmental groups and regulators to identify \nother areas where common ground can be reached, said Joe Nipper, chief \nlobbyist for the American Public Power Association.\nA smaller trade group, composed mainly of investor-owned <utilities>, is \nworking on its own set of principles.\nEnergy Secretary Bill Richardson acknowledged the stakeholder progress in an \nApril 17 speech to the National Energy Marketers Association, and he urged \nCongress to pass an <electric> restructuring bill.\n\"Our interstate <electricity> markets are in need of repair,\" Richardson \nsaid, adding that <transmission> access and generation capacity are \ndecreasing as demand for <electricity> grows. \"If Congress fails to act -- \nand act soon -- on restructuring legislation, it will strangle the \ndevelopment of competitive <electricity> markets.\"\nThe two committee chairmen who will have to spearhead a restructuring plan \nhave stated their intent to pass a bill by the end of the 106th Congress. But \nthey must navigate past obstacles that include the compressed calendar, \nelection-year politics and a general lack of knowledge among their colleagues \non how to rewrite or repeal <PUHCA>.\nOn April 27, Senate Energy Chairman Frank H. Murkowski, R-Alaska, will hold \nthe last of three hearings on eight <electric> deregulation-related measures.\nOn the House side, retiring Commerce Committee Chairman Thomas J. Bliley Jr., \nR-Va., has vowed to work toward enacting a bill (HR 2944) to encourage \nfurther state deregulation of the <electric> utility market. That measure, \nwhich would effectively allow consumers to buy their power from anyone, not \njust the nearest utility, was approved by the House Commerce Subcommittee on \nEnergy and Power on Oct. 27. (CQ Weekly, p. 478; 1999 CQ Weekly, p. 2599)\nThe bill also would give states the authority to handle their transition to a \ncompetitive market but contains no deadline, or \"date certain,\" by which \nstates would have to restructure.\nMoving a Senate Bill\nSome are skeptical that the political and practical hurdles can be overcome \nthis year. For example, while they have made progress on principles, the key \nnegotiators -- representing investor-owned <utilities>; <electric> \ncooperatives; municipal <electric> <utilities>; large <electricity> \nconsumers; labor unions, and environmental groups -- still must reach \nconsensus on details the legislation should address, as well as the \nlegislative language to implement any agreement.\n\"I think the chances of getting a bill enacted this year are low, not from \nthe lack of trying,\" Nipper said.\nThe best chance appears to lie in the Senate, where Murkowski's committee is \nconsidering eight bills. \"I am committed to getting something meaningful out \nof my committee,\" Murkowski said in an April 14 interview. Murkowski \nacknowledged, though, that the congressional schedule and narrow consensus on \neach of the bills pose challenges to his goal -- developing a comprehensive \nderegulation bill, not one that only addresses portions of <electric> \nrestructuring.\nThe path in the House appears more difficult, although one key supporter said \nthere is behind-the-scenes movement.\nBliley has promised to hold a markup of HR 2944 before Memorial Day, and he \nhas named a task force of six members to help move the bill through committee.\nJoe L. Barton, R-Texas, the sponsor of HR 2944, said meetings are taking \nplace among Bliley, Republican House staffers and some interested groups. \n\"There is some action; it's just not visible,\" Barton said late last month. \n\"I think what's happening there is that [stakeholders are] jockeying for \nposition.\"\nBarton said he anticipated that a \"fairly good bill\" could be moved by the \nmiddle of May if stakeholders and members come together.\nOne complication: Democrats, in the midst of the battle to regain control of \nthe House, may not move toward a consensus with Republicans. Staff aides for \nseveral Democratic members have already complained they have not heard from \nthe committee staff in trying to work out differences raised in subcommittee.\nBut others point to a 1992 energy law (PL 102-486) that cleared Congress in \nthe weeks before that year's election. It contained provisions allowing <\nutilities> and independent producers to compete in the wholesale power \nmarket; that law has been credited with the current wave of deregulation in \nsome markets. So far, 25 states and the District of Columbia have either \nrestructured their markets or enacted laws to begin retail competition in \ncoming years. (1992 Almanac, p. 231)\nMark Stultz, a spokesman for the <Electric> <Power> Supply Association, a \ngroup of competitive power suppliers and power marketers, said the 1992 law \nwas enacted after the <electric> industry quickly built up a consensus among \nmembers and educated them on what the bill would do.\n\"The industry was able to access that in a very short time,\" Stultz said. As \nfar as getting a restructuring bill through this year, Stultz said it is \"not \nan impossible, unrealizable goal to assume that we could get consensus,\" \nsince key stakeholders have reached agreement on several issues. They include \nblocking \"market power\" -- the ability of a few companies to stunt \ncompetition by effectively using its assets to manipulate the deregulated \nmarket to its advantage.\nWhile the House bill contains many issues stakeholders agree with, Stultz \nsaid it also contains some fatal flaws. He cited as an example its lack of \nfederal agency jurisdiction over \"bundled\" services in a regulated market, in \nwhich <electric> generation, <transmission> and distribution rates are \ncombined in an <electric> bill, and \"unbundled\" services in a deregulated \nmarket, in which the generation rates are broken apart from <transmission> \nand distribution rates and other temporary charges brought on by deregulation \nare included.\nBest Bets in the Senate\nOf the eight bills pending in the Senate, Nipper said the one with the best \nchance of passing is S 2071, sponsored by Slade Gorton, R-Wash., which is \nintended to encourage greater <electric> <reliability>. Nipper said the \nGorton bill would replace the North American <Electric> <Reliability> \nCouncil, a group in which utility participation is voluntary, with the <\nElectric> <Reliability> Organization, a board that would require \nparticipation by <utilities>. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would \nhave jurisdiction over the board, as well as the power to enforce its \npolicies on <utilities>.\nThe reliability issue is likely to intensify in coming months, due to \nproblems <electric> <utilities> faced each of the past two summers. While \nsome plants were undergoing needed maintenance, some <utilities> were caught \nwith their generation capacity down during periods of extremely high demand. \nThe resulting shortage triggered a spike in bulk <electric> prices, driving \nthe price of a megawatt-hour of <electricity> in a few places from $30 to as \nhigh as $7,000. <Utilities> enforced rotating blackouts on customers, asked \nconsumers to reduce <electric> use and passed on surcharges for the higher \ncost of <electricity>.\nHoping to avoid outages this summer, the Department of Energy has scheduled \nfour regional \"summits\" on <electric> <reliability> on April 24 and 28.\nJim Owen, a spokesman for the Edison <Electric> Institute, said a third \nconsecutive summer of service interruptions and significant price increases \ncould motivate Congress to move on the deregulation bill. \"It might push this \nthing up further on the congressional radar screen,\" although a law enacted \nimmediately would not have a quick impact on generation and <transmission> \nreliability, he said.\nOther thorny issues include:\n? How to handle taxation issues between publicly owned <utilities>, <electric\n> cooperatives and municipal <utilities>, and whether <utilities> should \nvoluntarily join, or be forced to join, \"regional <transmission> \norganizations\" designed to allow more efficient transfer of <electricity> \nacross the national grid.\n? Whether the federal government should be involved in regulating the \ninterstate <transmission> of <electric> <power>. Some stakeholders argue \nfederal regulation is necessary to prevent one state or region from \nprotecting its customers at the expense of others.\n? Environmental groups' desire for stronger anti-pollution restrictions on <\nutilities> that produce pollutants while generating <electricity>. And labor \ngroups, wary that deregulation could trigger massive layoffs through \ncorporate mergers and acquisitions, want to make sure their union members are \nprotected.\n\n"

The reduced\nemissions will be in place as soon as 2003, according to Massachusetts\nGovernor Paul Cellucci's (R) office.\n\n     The state approached the six plants and asked them to either reduce\ntheir emissions or face regulatory action by the Department of\nEnvironmental Protection. Cellucci said, \"We challenged these power plants\nto clean up their act, and they have answered our call to meet the most\ncomprehensive air emissions standards in the United States.\"\n\n     The agreement -- which the five operators of the six plants agreed\nto with the state -- is voluntary, but enforceable rules will follow.\n\n     Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift explained that the agreement\nresulted through \"cooperative efforts,\" but added, \"We will pursue new\nregulations through the Department of Environmental Protection to ensure\nthe plant owners' commitments are enforceable, and will require the\nfinalization of a detailed plan for each of the six facilities.\"\n\n     The regulations, which are expected to be proposed in the next few\nmonths -- will set standards of 1.5 ponds of nitrogen oxide and 3 pounds of\nsulfur dioxide per megawatt-hour.\n\n     The five companies -- including Sithe Energies, Inc., NRG Energy\nInc., PE&E, Western Massachusetts Electric Companies/ Northeast Utilities,\nand Southern Company/Southern Energy New England, LLC -- have submitted\npreliminary plans. Under the plans, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide\nemissions would be slashed by up to 50 percent, and mercury, particulate\nand carbon dioxide pollution would be curbed.\n\n     \"Our Air Quality Improvement Plan demonstrates that environmental\nexcellence works in today's competitive market,\" said James McGowan, senior\nvice president of Sithe. \"This is a win-win program that will produce the\nbest power plant for Sithe, the local communities and the environment as a\nwhole.\"\n\n     The statement counters many other utilities' position on the issue,\nparticularly the Midwestern coal-fired plants subject to a massive EPA\nenforcement action initiated late last year to have the facilities use\nupgraded pollution control technology. Specifically, the lawsuit charges\nthe utilities with noncompliance with New Source Review requirements of the\nClean Air Act.\n\n     The Massachusetts situation \"does undercut the arguments of\ndirtier, Midwestern companies that claim it can't be done,\" said Frank\nO'Donnell, with Clean Air Trust.\n\n     Pat Hemlepp, spokesperson for American Electric Power, one of the\nutilities involved in the EPA lawsuit, argued, however, \"that is like\ncomparing apples to oranges.\"\n\n     Though Northeastern states blame the Midwest for pollution\nmigrating in their air, Hemlepp explained that since there are no serious\nproblems with non-attainment with CAA regulation in the Midwest, stricter\ncontrols on utilities operating in that part of the country are\nunnecessary. \"States like Massachusetts have every right to go in and ask\nutilities within their state to upgrade. There are major non-attainment\nproblems in the Northeast, so it makes sense,\" Hemlepp argued.\n\n     And about EPA's lawsuit, \"What people overlook is that EPA's\nlawsuit is not about emissions, it's about what is and isn't legal under\nthe Clean Air Act. ... We feel very strongly that what we've done is\nlegal,\" Hemlepp said. \n"

They will reconvene sometime in the fall of 2000, most likely after \nelections, for the fall Veto session.  As most of you know who have been \nincluded in periodic e-mail updates during the session, we were tracking a \nnumber of bills throughout the session, and as we predicted mid way thru, no \nmajor bills that could negatively impact our businesses made it out as law.  \nHere's a short re cap on each issue:\n\n\"Coal scrubber\" bills on both sides fizzled out mid way thru the session and \ndid not ever make it to the floor for a vote.\n\n\"Peaking plant moratorium\" bills (there were between 3 and 4 that we tracked \nranging from riparian rights to outright moratoriums on development) \ncontinued to show up throughout the session, including a flurry of activilty \nabout 2 weeks ago.  The general consensus would be that a resolution would be \npassed to convene an advisory board, under the auspices of the the Governors \noffice, which would make recommendations to the legislature next year with an \nemphasis on groundwater issues.  That resolution (#71) passed out of the \nSenate on Friday and the House rules committee allowed it to be available for \nvote on the floor, but for some reason, it did not get called for a vote \nbefore the session adjourned on Saturday.  Despite not passing, I am sure \nthat the Governor's office will convene such an advisory committee on it's \nown.  The resolution only included 1 representative from the \"energy \nsupplier\" community, so we will probably petition the governor's office to \nadd at least one more to voice the concerns of the IPPs.\n\n\"Metering and Billing mortatorium\" bill, although pushed by the IBEW and \ntheir legislative sponsors all thru the session, was not ultimately passed.  \nWe had been active blocking and trying to add our own language to the bill as \nit moved, and had success in killing it in the Senate.  The unions tried many \nmany tactics on this bill, and I am confident that they will now turn their \nefforts to the ICC and will appeal the ICC's order if/when it is issued.\n\n\"Reliablity\" bills generally dealing with residential \ncustomers/penalites/outages, floundered throughout the session, and did not \nhave a direct impact on our interests.\n\nEnron Broadband Services issues were generally non issues this session--we \nexpect to see some significant action next year as the newly appointed joint \ncommittees will consider an overhaul of the current Illinois telecom statutes.\n\nPlease feel free to give me a call if I can provide any specific information \nthat you might be looking for on any of these issues. #612-339-4599"

          "body": "FYI -- This will hit the news later today or tomorrow....\n\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Clinton administration has decided to phase out MTBE as \na gasoline additive on grounds it poses a risk to public health or the \nenvironment,  government sources said today.\n\nMTBE, a leading oxygenate and octane booster, reduces emissions of smog, but \nit has been linked to groundwater pollution in California and elsewhere. It \nis used in one-third of\nthe gasoline sold in the United States.\n\nCarol Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, was \nannouncing this afternoon that her agency will seek to \"significantly reduce \nor eliminate\" use of MTBEs\nunder the Toxic Substance Control Act. That law allows EPA to ban chemicals \n\"deemed to pose an unreasonable risk to the public or the environment,\" said \na government official who\nspoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe agency also will ask Congress for changes in the Clean Air Act that will \nencourage use of ethanol, an additive from corn, in place of MTBE, according \nto a congressional source. The 1990 law requires the use of oxygenates in \ngasoline.\n\nThe EPA previously has said it has no authority to regulate MTBE, and \nCongress should act to limit its use in light of evidence the additive is \ncontaminating groundwater.  MTBE is used in all or part of 16 states, and is \nin much of the gasoline sold in the Northeast. Refiners turned to the \nadditive after the Clean Air Act required gasoline in areas with serious air \npollution to contain at least 2 percent oxygen by weight.\n\nLast summer, an EPA advisory panel said that while current levels of MTBE in \nwater pose no health risk, its use should be dramatically curtailed because \nof potential widespread water\npollution problems. MTBE has been found to be a carcinogen and poses health \nand environmental risks, other critics of the additive have said.\n\nThe sources said the EPA action was a \"backstop measure\" because Congress had \nnot acted to eliminate use of MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether.\n\nCalifornia, which has more leeway than other states to regulate air \npollution, has already decided to ban the use of MTBE by the end of 2002. \nState officials have asked the EPA for\na waiver from the Clean Air Act's oxygenate requirements so that the state \ndoesn't have to switch to ethanol, which is more expensive than MTBE.\n\nA coalition of Northeast states said last year said that low levels of MTBE \nwere found in 15 percent of the drinking water tested in the Northeast, in \nmost cases in amounts less than 2 parts per billion. Water begins to pose a \nhealth concern and tastes or smells bad at 30 to 70 parts per billion; about \n1 percent of water supplies tested in the Northeast had concentrations above \n35 parts per billion.\n\n\nAPTV-03-20-00 1109EST\n\n"

          "body": "BNA Environment Reporter\n\nOil, Ethanol Industries Far From Deal\nOn Pending Senate Bill to Limit MTBE\n\n\nOil and ethanol interests remain at odds as the Senate seeks to limit use of \nthe fuel additive methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), making it uncertain \nwhether the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will be able to \ncraft an acceptable national\nsolution to the problem of MTBE in water, lobbyists told BNA April 17-19.\n\nDespite fundamental differences, however, all sources interviewed for this \nstory--including two oil industry officials, three ethanol advocates, and \nseveral other sources active in the legislative process on this issue--said \nthat it still appeared possible that national MTBE legislation satisfying \nmultiple interests could be developed.\n\n\"I don't think we're at an impasse,\" one oil industry official said, echoing \ncomments by others in the debate. \"I just think it's going to take time.\" \nWhether this means that a compromise can be worked out during this \nlegislative session remains to be seen, this official and others said.\n\nThe committee chairman, Sen. Bob Smith (R-N.H.), has made MTBE a priority, \nsaying that Congress must eliminate the threat of water contamination posed \nby the fuel oxygenate while being careful to preserve the air quality \nbenefits associated with MTBE-mixed gasoline.\n\nThe chairman's view of the issue, however, is contrary to the view held by \nthe Clinton administration, by ranking minority member Sen. Max Baucus \n(D-Mont.), and by Democratic and Republican agricultural interests in the \nSenate. These forces hold that corn-derived ethanol and possibly other \n\"renewable\" fuels should gain a wider market under any legislation addressing \nthe threat of MTBE water contamination.\n\nThe oil industry and Smith disagree with that view.\n\nSmith Rejects 'Renewables' Linkage\n\nWhen the Clinton administration announced on March 20 its support for a \nnational renewable fuels mandate, Smith said \"the issue of renewable fuels \nhas absolutely nothing to do with eliminating MTBE from our drinking water.\" \nHe repeated this point in a newspaper opinion piece April 10.\n\nIn addition to gasoline and ethanol advocates, several other interest groups \nmaintain an active role in the ongoing debate, and Senate committee staff ar \ncontinuing behind-the-scenes meetings with all sides, sources said.\n\nGenerally, comprehensive MTBE legislation is expected to slash use of the \nadditive without necessarily eliminating it entirely. A committee bill also \nis expected to provide states with the option of waiving the Clean Air Act \nmandate currently driving the use of\nMTBE and ethanol, another fuel oxygenate. At the same time, such a bill is \nexpected to include \"no backsliding\" language to ensure that air toxics \nreductions achieved in the eastern United States over the last several years \nare maintained even if states\nwaive out of the air act mandate.\n\nSources said the committee also is weighing possible cleanup liability relief \nfor MTBE producers and enhancements to fuel storage tank clean up programs.\n\nHeavy Reliance on MTBE\n\nMTBE is a high-oxygen, high-octane gasoline additive that is one of the most \nheavily produced chemicals in the United States. With roughly 12 million \ngallons of MTBE mixed with gasoline each day in the United States, the \nchemical makes up more than 3 percent of gasoline by volume, according to the \noil industry.\n\nMTBE use is driven mainly by the Clean Air Act requirement that all \n\"reformulated gasoline\" contain at least 2 percent oxygen by weight. \nReformulated gasoline is sold in areas of the country with poor air quality. \nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, more than 80 percent of \nreformulated gasoline production relies on MTBE to meet the oxygen \nrequirement.\n\nHowever, MTBE smells somewhat like turpentine and has been detected in public \nwater supplies, rendering at least a few of those supplies undrinkable. The \nhealth effects of drinking MTBE in water are little known, but the chemical \ndoes taste and smell bad, according to a February report by the Congressional \nResearch Service.\n\nRFG programs in Chicago and Milwaukee rely on ethanol for oxygen content in \ntheir reformulated gasoline. Among other concerns in the legislative debate, \nthe ethanol industry fears losing this market if Congress eliminates the 2 \npercent oxygen requirement in the Clean Air Act to address MTBE concerns, one \nindustry representative said.\n\nThere were 1.5 billion gallons of ethanol mixed into gasoline in 1999, \naccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. USDA chief economist Keith \nCollins said before the Senate Agricultural Committee April 11 that there are \n55 ethanol plants in operation in\n\"nearly 20 states.\"\n\nBill Would Ease 2 Percent Oxygen Rule\n\nTo address water quality concerns, Smith has signed on to legislation (S. \n1886) that would allow states to lift the 2 percent mandate driving MTBE use.\n\nIntroduced by Inhofe and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), S. 1886 would not \nban or phase down MTBE outright. However, this is expected to change when and \nif the Environment and Public Works committee marks up more comprehensive \nlegislation, oil, ethanol, and other sources said.\n\n\"I think there's a growing set of opinion ... that MTBE either needs to be \nphased down to historic levels or phased out entirely over a period of some \nyears,\" an oil industry source said.\n\nChemical companies that make MTBE disagree and continue to urge an overhaul \nof underground storage tank programs in order to mitigate water contamination.\n\nAccording to one source familiar with the issue, Senate committee staff \nmembers are considering several legislative ideas that might address concerns \nof MTBE interests. Prospective liability relief from contamination cleanup \ncosts is under consideration, as is the idea that MTBE makers should get \nexpedited review of required permits when switching to alternate chemical \nproducts.\n\nIn addition, the committee may be considering more rigorous regulation of \nunderground storage tanks as part of comprehensive MTBE legislation, this \nsource said.\n\nDaschle, Harkin Drafts\n\nAt least 14 bills have been introduced in the 106th Congress to address the \nproblem of MTBE in water, according to the Congressional Research Service \nreport. The report said most bills would either eliminate the Clean Air Act \nrequirement driving oxygenate use or would explicitly ban MTBE.\n\nSome of the bills would bolster the Environmental Protection Agency's \nunderground storage tank program since leaking USTs are considered the main \ncause of water contamination. This approach is supported by certain MTBE \nmakers, who told BNA that water contamination is caused by leaking tanks and \nnot by the high-quality fuel additive.\n\nAdditional draft bills are pending introduction, including comprehensive \nlegislation by Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), the Senate minority leader, that \nwould significantly curtail MTBE use by 2004 while letting states take action \nbefore then.\n\nDaschle's bill--said by Baucus's staff to be supported by the ranking EPW \ncommittee member--also would bolster ethanol production through a national \nrenewable fuels mandate, expanding national average ethanol use to 2 percent \nor more over the next 10 years.\n\nIn addition, the draft legislation would amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act \nto get states the money they need to implement UST cleanup programs.\n\nEthanol supporter Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) also is drafting MTBE legislation \nthat he hopes to introduce soon after the Senate's Easter recess, a \nspokeswoman said. Harkin is ranking minority member of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee and supports a renewable fuels standard. \"If crafted in the right \nway,'' Harkin has said, such a standard \"could result in far more ethanol use \nthan current law.\"\n\nIowa ranks second after Illinois in total ethanol production capacity, \naccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Nebraska ranks third and \nMinnesota ranks fourth.\n\nRFG Market\n\nDespite calls for eliminating the 2 percent oxygenate requirement in the \nreformulated gasoline program, ethanol interests said they still support \nmaintenance of the requirement combined with an MTBE ban.\n\nSuch a scenario would leave ethanol to fill the RFG market void, doubling \nethanol use over three to five years, sources said. If Congress were to \neliminate the 2 percent mandate but institute a national renewable fuels \nrequirement, ethanol use also is expected to at least double from current \nlevels. However, it would do so over a longer period of about 10 years, one \nethanol source said.\n\nOil industry officials, as well as Northeast states and some environmental \nadvocates, oppose this simple MTBE ban because it would create a \"de facto \nethanol mandate.\" The oil industry also continues to oppose a national \nrenewable fuels standard, officials said.\n\nA representative of Northeast states told a Senate panel April 11 that Smith \nappeared to be exploring a compromise with ethanol interests, considering a \nnational average \"alternative fuel\" requirement that would benefit ethanol as \nwell as natural gas, electricity, and other transportation fuels.\n\nThe Northeast representative, Jason Grumet of Northeast States for \nCoordinated Air Use Management, supports the national average, alternative \nfuel approach, since it would offer the ethanol industry market share without \nrequiring the Northeast to use large quantities of Midwest-derived ethanol.\n\nHowever, oil company interests reaffirmed April 17 their long-held opposition \nto any new fuel mandates, saying concerns over MTBE in water should be \naddressed by eliminating current statutory mandates and not by instituting \nany new mandates.\n\nOil companies are particularly firm in their position given that agricultural \nstates are expected to play a key role in upcoming presidential elections, a \nsecond oil industry official said. It is not simply that the industry opposes \nnew mandates--though that is\nthe case--but also that an ethanol-mandate \"bidding war\" might erupt in a \nyear when  Republicans and Democrats are vying for Midwestern votes, the \nofficial said.\n\nEthanol Supporters Want Expansion\n\nMeanwhile, ethanol interests said they will continue to fight for expansion \nof their product in the RFG market, and do not necessarily see a national \nrenewable fuels mandate as a legislative compromise.\n\nThe Clinton administration's renewable standard would require ethanol use \ninitially at current levels of about 1.2 percent of gasoline. The mandate \nwould then expand over 10 years, administration officials have said.\n\nEthanol is more volatile than MTBE, making it more difficult for oil refiners \nto produce summertime gasoline that meets low emissions requirements for \nvolatile organic compounds. This is one reason the \"de facto mandate\" is \nopposed by Northeast states and environmental interests. Some of the \nrenewables mandates under consideration in Congress would allow refiners to \nmeet requirements over an annual average, enabling them to avoid or reduce \ntheir ethanol use in summer.\n\nNo Markup Scheduled\n\nSmith staff confirmed only that discussions with oil, ethanol, environmental, \nMTBE, and state interests continue. A spokesman said comprehensive MTBE \nlegislation \"is something we're trying to get done quickly,\" but that a bill \nmarkup has not been scheduled.\n\nDiscussions leading to a full EPW committee markup of more comprehensive MTBE \nlegislation are important to the legislative process, sources said, because a \nbill is not expected to weather floor debate without early support from \nDemocrats and Republicans on the committee, as well as from members of the \nSenate Agricultural Committee.\n\n\"I just can't see this getting duked out on the floor,\" said one ethanol \nlobbyist. \"I think that we, the MTBE folks, the oil company folks, and the \nenvironmentalists all recognize that there is mutually assured destruction on \nthe floor.\"\n\nAccording to one source, a new version of the bill is expected to push MTBE \nuse down to pre-1990 levels over about four years. Before the 1990 air act \namendments required the sale of reformulated gasoline, MTBE was used mainly \nto enhance octane.\n\nIt is unclear whether the bill will somehow prove acceptable to both \nDemocrats and Republicans, ethanol and oil interests, as well as to Northeast \nstates, the Midwest, and California.\n\n\"Things change day to day,\" an oil industry official said. \"I think the issue \ncould be resolved without the ethanol piece, but the ethanol piece is just so \ndifficult,\" he added.\n\n\"I think right now the chairman is poking around in the mud to find somewhere \nwith solid footing,\" an ethanol industry source said."

It is not simply that the industry opposes \nnew mandates--though that is\nthe case--but also that an ethanol-mandate \"bidding war\" might erupt in a \nyear when  Republicans and Democrats are vying for Midwestern votes, the \nofficial said.\n\nEthanol Supporters Want Expansion\n\nMeanwhile, ethanol interests said they will continue to fight for expansion \nof their product in the RFG market, and do not necessarily see a national \nrenewable fuels mandate as a legislative compromise.\n\nThe Clinton administration's renewable standard would require ethanol use \ninitially at current levels of about 1.2 percent of gasoline. The mandate \nwould then expand over 10 years, administration officials have said.\n\nEthanol is more volatile than MTBE, making it more difficult for oil refiners \nto produce summertime gasoline that meets low emissions requirements for \nvolatile organic compounds. This is one reason the \"de facto mandate\" is \nopposed by Northeast states and environmental interests. Some of the \nrenewables mandates under consideration in Congress would allow refiners to \nmeet requirements over an annual average, enabling them to avoid or reduce \ntheir ethanol use in summer.\n\nNo Markup Scheduled\n\nSmith staff confirmed only that discussions with oil, ethanol, environmental, \nMTBE, and state interests continue. A spokesman said comprehensive MTBE \nlegislation \"is something we're trying to get done quickly,\" but that a bill \nmarkup has not been scheduled.\n\nDiscussions leading to a full EPW committee markup of more comprehensive MTBE \nlegislation are important to the legislative process, sources said, because a \nbill is not expected to weather floor debate without early support from \nDemocrats and Republicans on the committee, as well as from members of the \nSenate Agricultural Committee.\n\n\"I just can't see this getting duked out on the floor,\" said one ethanol \nlobbyist. \"I think that we, the MTBE folks, the oil company folks, and the \nenvironmentalists all recognize that there is mutually assured destruction on \nthe floor.\"\n\nAccording to one source, a new version of the bill is expected to push MTBE \nuse down to pre-1990 levels over about four years. Before the 1990 air act \namendments required the sale of reformulated gasoline, MTBE was used mainly \nto enhance octane.\n\nIt is unclear whether the bill will somehow prove acceptable to both \nDemocrats and Republicans, ethanol and oil interests, as well as to Northeast \nstates, the Midwest, and California.\n\n\"Things change day to day,\" an oil industry official said. \"I think the issue \ncould be resolved without the ethanol piece, but the ethanol piece is just so \ndifficult,\" he added.\n\n\"I think right now the chairman is poking around in the mud to find somewhere \nwith solid footing,\" an ethanol industry source said."

As you will \nrecall, the House Republicans have always stated that they needed Democrat \nvotes in order to bring the matter to the floor for a vote.  Despite Governor \nVilsack's stated support for the measure last week as well as last weekend, \nthe House  Democrat leadership is unwilling to push their members, as they \nwant to use this bill against the Republicans in the House races this fall. \n(The tactic they will take is that residential rates will rise in the \nSoutheastern part of the state due to the Republicans passing the bill).\n\nThe primary issue that the Dems are using as a reason not to vote for the \nbill is that the enviromental protections/funds are not high enough.  The \nRepublicans are unhappy about the exhorbitant amount of funds and the RPS \nthat are already in the bill, and are not willing to vote for an amended bill \nthat the Dems are pushing for.  The enviros and the unions are, as they have \nbeen for the last 6 months, the dividing force in this debate.\n\nTherefore, the proponents coalition moved their efforts to the Senate, with \nthe hope of getting a vote out this week and then move it back over to the \nHOuse.  While we had a good commitment from Senate leadership (both Dems and \nRepublicans) on Monday, that support has eroded as of this morning.  We are \ntrying a number of tactics, and hope that there will be some positive \nmovement today and tomorrow.  Without the Governor stepping up to the plate \nand \"encouraging\" the democrats to gather the number of democrat votes \nneccessary this week, I am not optimistic about passage.\n\nThere are still two-three weeks of session left, so this debate could rage \nuntil then, but my sense is that if we don't get something out of the Senate \nby the end of this week or early next week, we'll be dead.  Call if you have \nany questions.\n#612-339-4599\n\n\n\n\n"

          "subject": "EPA principles for MTBE ban",
          "body": "Attached below is a copy of EPA's legislative principles for phasing out MTBE \nuse.   These principles have been criticized by Members of Congress -- even \noxygenate bill sponsor Brian Bilbray -- as being very vague and lacking any \nhelpful information whatsoever.   At the House Commerce Committee hearing a \nfew weeks ago, EPA Assistant Administrator Perciasepe was blasted for not \nhaving submitted anything in detail that would help Congress solve the \ncomplex RFG/MTBE issue.  These empty prinicples will not likely help EPA in \nmoving forward with their regulatory plans.\n\n*******\n\nLEGISLATIVE PRINCIPLES FOR PROTECTING DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES,\nPRESERVING CLEAN AIR BENEFITS, AND PROMOTING RENEWABLE FUELS\n\nThe Federal Reformulated Gasoline Program (RFG) established in the Clean Air \nAct Amendments of 1990 has provided substantial reductions in the emissions \nof a number of air pollutants from motor vehicles, most notably volatile \norganic compounds and nitrogen oxides (precursors of ozone), carbon monoxide, \nand air toxics (benzene, 1,3-butadiene, and others).  In most cases these \nreductions have exceeded those required by law.\n\nHowever, the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (\"MTBE\") in our nation's fuel \nsupply has created a significant and unacceptable risk to drinking water and \nground water resources.  As a result of these concerns, last year EPA \ncommissioned a Blue Ribbon Panel on MTBE and Oxygenates in Gasoline (the \n\"Panel\").  On July 27, 1999 the Panel issued recommendations on ways to \nmaintain air quality while protecting water quality from the risks associated\nwith MTBE.  Significantly, the Panel called for a substantial reduction in \nthe use of MTBE as well as action by Congress to remove the current 2% \noxygenate requirement from the Clean Air Act.  EPA endorsed the Panel's \nrecommendations and committed to work with Congress to make targeted \namendments to the Clean Air Act.\n\nIn the months since the Panel issued its recommendations, detections of MTBE \nin water supplies have grown and Congress has not yet acted to address this \nissue.  It is of increasing importance to enact legislation that addresses \nthis problem in an environmentally sound and cost-effective way. Such \nlegislation should provide authority to phase out MTBE while avoiding \ngasoline supply shortages and ensuring price stability.\n\nThe following legislative principles, taken together as a single package, are \ndesigned to maintain air quality and enhance water quality protection while \npreserving the significant role of renewable fuels, most importantly \nethanol.  In addition, it is the Administration's intention that the \nresulting legislation provide sufficient flexibility with respect to both \ntime and range of technological choices so as to allow for continued adequate \nsupplies of gasoline at reasonable prices for consumers.\n\nRecommendation #1: Amend the Clean Air Act to provide the authority to \nsignificantly reduce or eliminate the use of MTBE.\n\nThe rising number of MTBE detections in ground and surface water in some \nareas of the nation have increased the urgency for preventing further MTBE \ncontamination.  In some cases, communities have been forced to abandon their \ndrinking water supply.  To effectively address this growing problem, the \nAdministration recommends that Congress amend the Clean Air Act to provide \nthe authority to significantly reduce or eliminate the use of MTBE. \n\n\nRecommendation #2: As MTBE use is reduced or eliminated, ensure that air \nquality gains are not diminished.\n\nThe clean burning Reformulated Gasoline Program has helped bring clean air to \ncities across the nation.  In many cases, Americans have enjoyed air quality \nimprovements that have exceeded expectations.  The Administration recommends \nthat as Congress significantly reduces or eliminates MTBE, it institute \nmeasures that maintain our air quality gains.\n\nRecommendation #3: Replace the existing oxygen requirement contained in the \nClean Air Act with a renewable fuel standard for all gasoline.\n\nReducing or eliminating MTBE in no way diminishes the continued need for \nother oxygenates, such as ethanol, to control mobile source emissions.  In \naddition, a significant role for renewable fuels is important to our nation's \nenergy supply (see, EO 13134 in which President Clinton sets a goal of \ntripling the use of renewable bio-energy by 2010).  Thus, the Administration \nrecommends that Congress replace the 2% oxygenate requirement in the Clean \nAir Act with a renewable fuel annual average content for all gasoline at a \nlevel that maintains the current level of renewable fuel (1.2% of the \ngasoline supply) and allows for sustained growth over the next decade.\n\nCongressional action on these recommendations is essential if we are to \ncontinue to achieve the clean air public health benefits of cleaner burning \ngasoline while avoiding unacceptable risks to our nation's water supplies.  \nThe Administration urges Congress to address this request for legislation as \nquickly as possible. We remain committed to working with Congress to provide \na targeted legislative solution to this matter."

          "subject": "EPA Fact Sheet on RFG",
          "body": "FYI -- More information from EPA to back up its recent announcement:\n\nOxygenates in Gasoline\n\nCongress required, in the Clean Air Act of 1990, that areas of the country \nwith the worst ozone smog problems use reformulated gasoline (RFG) with an \nincreased oxygen content of 2%. Seventeen states and the District of Columbia \npresently use reformulated gasoline (RFG), either because of the \nCongressional mandate, or because some areas have voluntarily chosen to use \nRFG to help achieve their clean air goals.  Methyl tertiary-butyl ether \n(MTBE) is the oxygen additive most commonly used by the petroleum industry to \nsatisfy the RFG mandate.  MTBE is used in approximately 87% of RFG, with \nethanol being the second most commonly used additive.  Of those areas listed \nbelow, only Milwaukee and Chicago use RFG that is primarily ethanol.\n\n\nAreas Required to Use RFG\n\nAreas That Have Voluntarily Chosen to Use RFG\n\nLos Angeles, CA\nSan Diego, CA\nHartford, CT\nNew York City (NY-CT-NJ)\nGreater Philadelphia (PA-NJ-DE-MD)\nChicago (IL-WI-IN)\nBaltimore, MD\nHouston, TX\nMilwaukee, WI\nSacramento, CA\nThe State of Connecticut (that portion not part of\nNYC)\nThe State of Delaware (that portion not part of Phil.)\nThe District of Columbia\nKentucky portion of Cincinnati Metro Area\nLouisville, KY\nMaryland - DC suburbs and two other nearby counties\nThe State of Massachusetts\nSt. Louis, MO\nNew Hampshire Portion of Greater Boston\nThe State of New Jersey (that portion not part of NYC\nand Phil.)\nNew York counties near NYC\nThe State of Rhode Island\nTexas - Dallas-Fort Worth area\nVirginia - DC suburbs, Richmond, Norfolk-Virginia\nBeach-Newport News\n\nSince the late 1970s, MTBE also has been used by the petroleum industry in \nmuch smaller amounts as an octane enhancer to replace lead. Approximately 4.5 \nbillion gallons of MTBE are used each year in gasoline (275,000 barrels per \nday out of a total of 8.2 million barrels/day of gasoline), an increase of \nmore than 3 times since Congress's 1990 mandate.\n\nMTBE in Water\n\nSince MTBE is very soluble in water and does not \"cling\" to soil well, it has \na tendency to migrate much more quickly into water than other components of \ngasoline.  Recent testing by the United States Geological Survey show \ndetections of MTBE in approximately 20% of the ground water in RFG areas, \nwhile there is only a 2% detection rate in non-RFG areas.  Most of these \ndetections are below the levels of public health concern and are within the \nrange\nEPA has set for a taste and odor water advisory for MTBE at 20 to 40 parts \nper billion.  Small individual fuel spills (more than 9 million gallons of \ngasoline each year) and storm water runoff contribute to low level detections \nof MTBE in water supplies.  MTBE detections at higher concentrations usually \nresult from leaking underground or aboveground fuel storage tanks and \npipelines.  Even though significant air quality gains have been made using \nRFG, these air benefits can be maintained without using MTBE and without \nendangering the nation's water resources.\n\nMTBE - Call to Action\n\nIn response to the growing concerns regarding MTBE in water, EPA \nAdministrator Browner appointed an independent Blue Ribbon Panel of experts \nto investigate the use of oxygen additives in gasoline.  The Panel called for \nsignificant reduction in the use of MTBE in gasoline and recommended that \nCongress and EPA take action to lift the oxygen mandate and clean up MTBE \ncontamination.  EPA fully supports the Panel recommendations and is taking \nsteps to strengthen its underground storage tank, safe drinking water, \nremediation, and research programs. Upon release of the Panel's report in \nSeptember 1999, EPA immediately began working with and encouraging Congress \nto pass legislation that responded to the Panel's recommendations.  To date, \nlegislation that would solve  this problem has not moved forward.  EPA is now \nproviding Congress with a framework for legislation that will give EPA the \nauthority to significantly reduce or eliminate MTBE.  EPA is also taking \naction to control MTBE under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) as a \nbackup to the needed Congressional action.  A TSCA rulemaking is procedurally \nburdensome and may take several years to complete.\n\nEthanol Use Will Expand\n\nCurrent annual ethanol production is about 1.5 billion gallons.  Of this \ntotal, about 30 percent is used in RFG during the summer in Federally \ndesignated non-attainment areas.  About 20 percent of ethanol production is \nused in the winter oxygenate program in Federally designated areas where \ncarbon monoxide is a problem.  The remaining 50 percent of production is used \nin conventional gasoline markets around the United States to enhance octane \nand extend fuel supplies.\n\nWith today's announcement by Secretary Glickman and Administrator Browner, \nethanol use is expected to continue to grow.  Provided air quality gains \nachieved to date are not reduced, ethanol will continue to be used very much \nas it is used today.  In areas of the country where it is heavily used, \nethanol will continue to be favored based on its price, availability and \nenvironmental benefits.   Other areas may also find ethanol to be an economic \nway to maintain air quality benefits that had been achieved with the use of \nMTBE.  Without the renewable fuels standard, some petroleum-based substitutes \nfor ethanol may emerge over time.  The proposed renewable fuels standard \nwould ensure that the current market for ethanol would be maintained and \nexpand over time.\n\nThe renewable fuels standard will be met through the use of fuels made from a \nvariety of renewable feedstocks. While most ethanol now is made from corn, \nother crops, such as wheat and sorghum, have and could also be used.  In \naddition, new conversion technologies now in development are expected to be \navailable in the future for efficient conversion of cellulosic material to \nethanol.  These technologies would make possible the broader use of a wide \narray of renewable feedstocks, including agricultural waste and residue, such \nas corn stalks, and dedicated crops, such as switchgrass.\n\nThe President has set a goal to triple U.S. use of biobased products and \nbioenergy by 2010.  The Administration's FY 2001 budget proposes an increase \nof $96 million (56 percent) to support biobased products and bioenergy \nresearch and development, demonstration and commercialization, and outreach \nand education activities.  The President also directed USDA's Commodity \nCredit Corporation to provide up to $100 million in FY 2000 and up to $150 \nmillion in 2001 and 2002 in incentive payments to ethanol and other bioenergy \nproducers to expand production of biobased fuels.  Payments will be made on a \nportion of the increase in agricultural commodities purchased for expanded \nbioenergy production, with smaller and cooperatively-owned facilities \nreceiving higher payment rates.\n\n                             ###"

As \nyou are aware, Senator Lugar and Congressman Ewing asked us to work with the \nCFTC to resolve our disagreement over how energy and other nonfinancial \ncommodities should be regulated.  This dispute and the even more significant \ndispute over SEC-CFTC jurisdiction (the Accord) are the most significant \nremaining issues with the legislation.  In that context, you may be aware \nthat the CFTC and SEC reported to Congress yesterday that they have not been \nable to work out the Accord issues.  We were informed prior to our meeting \nthis morning that the House and Senate bills on CFTC reauthorization are \nlikely to be introduced today.  I will transmit copies as soon as I get \nthem.   It is my understanding that both bills do a good job for us with \nrespect to legal certainty for energy and other nonfinancial commodities.\n\nIn this light, we met with the CFTC and reviewed with them the attached \ntwo-page legislative proposal.  The most significant problem that we have is \nthe CFTC's discomfort at providing an exclusion for bilateral, nonfinancial \ntransactions.  In essence, the CFTC does not want to go beyond the \nrecommendations of the President's Working Group.  We have continued to \ninsist that nonfinancial bilateral transactions be treated like financial \nbilateral transactions and be carved out of CFTC jurisdiction.  Our meeting \nwas very cordial and the CFTC said that they would be taking our comments \ninto consideration.  Unfortunately, inability to get passed the bilateral \nissue effectively forecloses resolution of the other issues in our outline.\n\nSeparately, we understand the CFTC is moving forward with its regulatory \nrelief package which they hope to publish sometime next week.

          "subject": "Pipeline Safety Legislation",
          "body": "Steve:\n\nAs you requested, the following is a detailed update on pipeline safety \nlegislation currently moving through Congress:\n\nPipeline safety reauthorization legislation\n\nAuthorization for pipeline safety programs, as administered by the U.S. Dept. \nof Transportation, Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), is currently set to \nexpire at the end of FY 2000.    At the beginning of the 106th Congress, \nindustry was focused on securing a simple, two year re-authorization bill \nthat basically extends current pipeline safety programs with some modest \nincreases in funding levels.  In fact, the House Commerce Committee (who \nshares jurisdiction over pipeline safety with the Transportation & \nInfrastructure Committee) acted early in 1999 to pass a simple, two year \nreauthorization bill (H.R. 1378).\n\nUnfortunately, the issue became more complex from that point.   A serious \nliquid pipeline accident in Bellingham, Washington that occurred last summer, \nkilling several children, dramatically changed the debate over pipeline \nsafety.   Members of the House and Senate from Washington state (backed by \nthe governor and numerous state and local officials) moved swiftly to \nintroduce legislation that they feel is designed to address some of the \nshortcomings in federal pipeline regulation that they believe may have \nallowed the Bellingham incident to occur.\n\nIn the Senate, Senator Patty Murray (D-WA) has introduced S. 2004, which is \ndesigned to expand State authority over interstate pipelines in several new \nareas, such as inspection and testing, emergency response plans, leak \ndetection, and operator training and qualification.   The bill also would \nauthorize a large increase in OPS funding through pipeline user fees, to \nincrease the amount of grants to the States, allow for hiring of additional \ninspectors, and increase R&D for inspection and leak detection technologies.  \nThe current OPS budget is around $36 million (with $30 million from user \nfees) -- the Murray bill would authorize $50 million in FY2001, which would \nrequire a sizeable increase in user fees.  Senator Slade Gorton (R-WA) has \nrecently decided to co-sposnor the Murray bill, and will be actively involved \nin trying to gain Republican support for the bill.   On the House side, Rep. \nJack Metcalf (R-WA) has introduced a similar bill, H.R. 3558, which a number \nof the Washington representatives have co-sponsored.\n\nInterstate natural gas pipelines have been placed in a very difficult \nsituation.    The Bellingham incident was a liquid pipeline accident, and \nliquids pipelines generally have less stringent regulatory requirements than \nnatural gas pipelines.   The Washington delegation has highlighted the fact \nthat 280 deaths and 1500 injuries have occurred over the past 14 years \nrelated to natural gas pipeline incidents, but they fail to distinguish the \nfact that almost all of those incidents were on LDC systems (which \nironically, are entirely State regulated).  Only 39 fatalities in that period \nwere natural-gas related, and the majority of those accidents were caused by \nthird party damage.  In short, the INGAA crowd is being dragged down by the \npoor records of the LDCs and the liquid pipelines.    \n\nThe calls for more state regulation of interstate pipeline are largely \nmisguided, based on the fact that the interstate pipelines under federal \nregulation have an exemplary safety record.   In addition, OPS is already \nworking on a \"Pipeline Integrity\" Rulemaking that would implement a number of \nadditional measures to prevent accidents on federally-regulated pipelines.\n\nAs you mentioned, INGAA has not been doing the best job representing us on \nthese issues.  They have been working in a group effort with API, AGA, and \nthe Association of Oil Pipelines (AOPL) to try and deflect the negative \nclaims of the Murray and Metcalf legislation, but have not been forceful \nenough in distinguishing interstate natural gas pipelines' positive record \nfrom the liquids and LDCs.  Thus, they have given the impression that INGAA \ncompanies might be willing to submit to additional regulation that liquids \nand LDC are under political pressure to submit to due to Bellingham.  We have \nbeen working with other major INGAA companies (El Paso, in particular) to \nmake sure that the perspective and positive record of our natural gas \npipelines is heard clearly by the key legislators.\n\nThe odds of these measures (S. 2004, H.R. 3558) passing on their own is \nfairly slim.   They will get a great deal of attention, however.  The Senate \nCommerce Committee held a field hearing in Bellingham, Washington yesterday, \nat which Senators Gorton and Murray testified along with OPS and the families \nof Bellingham victims -- the press coverage was not good (i.e., USA Today \ncover story \"When Pipelines Are Time Bombs\").   These bills (or portions of \nthem) will likely be offered and considered as amendments to Pipeline Safety \nReauthorization legislation as it comes before the House Transportation & \nInfrastructure and Senate Commerce Committee later this year.   \n\nThe increased controversy caused by these bills will likely doom efforts to \npass a pipeline safety reauthorization bill this year.   The leadership of \nthe House and Senate Committees will not likely want to face a bitter debate \nbetween safety advocates, OPS, States, and industry in their committees in \nthis tough election year.   While this is probably a good sign, there is an \nincreased risk that industry may face some large hurdles in the \nappropriations process.\n\nAppropriations Legislation\n\nWhile Members of Congress push for their stand alone bills and/or amendments \nto reauthorization bills, the greater danger is that some of these issues \nwill be dealt with in an appropriations context.    In particular, the fact \nthat Senator Slade Gorton is now actively engaged in pushing for extensive \npipeline safety reforms is troubling -- he is a key member of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, is close to Republican leadership, and has a tough \nre-election fight coming up.   Senator Murray is also on Senate \nAppropriations.  Both are on the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, \nwhich funds OPS.\n\nIt is quite likely that the Senators will make a push to get increases in the \nOPS budget for FY 2001 that would enable the kinds of reforms contemplated by \ntheir stand-alone legislation (more state funding, more inspectors, more \nR&D).  Much of this increase would be funded through increases in user fees.  \nINGAA indicates that it expects we could be facing increases in the range of \n10-15% from FY2000.   There is also the possibility that an attempt will be \nmade to add legislative riders to the OPS appropriations -- such as requiring \nOPS to mandate inspections, increase operator qualifications, or allow \nincreased state authority.   I would predict that legislative riders can be \nprevented, but it will be very difficult to avoid some kind of increases \n(beyond mere adjustments for inflation) in the OPS budget and user fees.  \n\nThe reauthorization will indeed receive attention in 2000, but our advocacy \nefforts will clearly need to be focused on the appropriations process, in \norder to minimize the impact on interstate pipeline user fees and prevent \nother harmful mandates.  \n\nWe will continue to work with key members of the authorizing and \nappropriations committees to ensure that the interstate natural gas \nperspective is clearly heard and, if possible, we avoid being dragged down in \nattempts to impose more strict regulation on liquids and LDCs.\n\nPlease let me know if you have questions or require additional information.  \nThank you."

It is widely anticipated that debate will go on for many days, with \nthe hope that the bill can get passed over to the Senate by April 3, so that \nthey can spend at least a week on the debate.\n\nThe Governor issued a statement that basically said that his office believed \nthat moving forward is a good thing, but that he was going to leave it up to \nthe legislators to either vote it up or down.  We believe that if the bill \ncomes out in substantially the same manner as it now sits, the Governor will \nsign it.  \n\nThere are still raging disagreements on the environmental pieces....Enron has \ntried to remain as neutral as possible on the renewables section due to our \nbusiness interests in Iowa with Enron Wind.  \n\nAs I have stated in earlier updates, this bill most likely will not pass \nuntil the last few days of the session, sometime in Mid April."

Regardless of our relationship with CSUF, there is no such thing as \n\"draft\" correspondence outside of Enron.  Everything that is sent outside the \ncompany, and most correspondence within the company, is discoverable in \nlitigation, whether it has been blessed or not.  I am especially concerned \nabout that statement that Enron intends to escalate this matter within Enron, \nPG&E and/or the CPUC, since with Project Mercury going on we may have \nstrategic reasons not to discuss this project with PG&E or the CPUC that \noverride our interest in CSUF.  In addition, I am concerned that if PG&E gets \na hold of this correspondence, it may be used against us in the future as a \nmeans to twist our chronology around.  I also need to get clear verification \nof the chronology and breakdown of costs so that we can be sure that we \npresent our story in the best possible light.\n\nAgain, please do not send any more correspondence to CSUF regarding this \nproject, and especially regarding Enron's future actions with regard to this \nproject, without clearing it beforehand with Legal and Gov't Affairs, whether \n\"draft\" or otherwise.  In addition, we will need to send CSUF an email either \n\"retracting\" the correspondence you just sent or stating that CSUF must not \nrely on the correspondence until we have verified all of the facts \nsurrounding our view of the project.  I will assist you in drafting this \nemail to CSUF.\n\nThanks for helping keep this under control until we have all of the \nstakeholders, including our betters in Houston, fully apprised of the \nsituation.\n\nPls call or email if you would like to discuss further.\n\nAW\n\n\n\nFrom: Dirk vanUlden/Western Region/The Bentley Company@Exchange on 03/10/2000 \n06:06 PM CST\nTo: Bob Boyd <robertb@csufresno.edu>@SMTP@Exchange, Dick Smith \n<dicks@csufresno.edu>@SMTP@Exchange\ncc: Tom Riley/Western Region/The Bentley Company@Exchange, Geoff \nPollard/Western Region/The Bentley Company@Exchange, Jeff \nDasovich/SFO/EES@EES, Andrew Wu/HOU/EES@EES \nSubject: Draft Letter for Ben Quillian\n\nBob and Dick - as you requested, I am attaching a draft chronology letter for \nyour use.

The idea in the transaction for which they were tailored was that \nthe California Energy Commission (\"CEC\") and three California UDC's would \ndivert payments they were otherwise  required to make to a blackballed ESP \ninto the infamous \"Lockbox.\"  The bank-administrator of the Lockbox was to \nswear in blood to send money coming into the lockbox to our account first and \ndribble any leftovers to the blackballed ESP as they saw fit.  Also,  the \nmili-second that the funds plunked into the Lockbox a virulent \"Security \nInterest\" attached itself like a vampire to the juggler vein of these funds \nand this security interest was for our benefit.  \n\n Although I am proud to have the  name Yoder associated with the Lockbox \nconcept,  I must in all modesty confess I have never closed out a real deal \nusing the damn thing.  Stewart Rosman, an innovative trader who is well known \nfor his patience with the legal process,  and later,  John \"Big Sky\" \nMalowney,   tried valiantly to get Legal to implement this sturcture but \nalas, I cannot yet put it on my resume as a triumph.

Nonetheless, we \nshould try and focus our testimony on those things in the Post-Interim that \nare objectionable and inconsistent with the Commission's Most Promising \nOptions.? I would use all of our \"powder\" on the Post-Interim arguments and \nlimit our opinions on the viability of the Interim (at least some of the \nInterim signatories will take this approach).??

          "body": "For the record, I have read Judge Biren's ruling, and contrary to what people \nmight have said in the conference call on Friday, it is silent on the topics \nof the testimony schedule and the presentation of arguments.  The \nthree-sentence e-mail from Biren simply requests that the parties attend the \nPHC at which time she will rule on the motion, and states that she might \nissue a further ruling prior to the PHC.  I think it is probably fair to \nexpect she may solicit brief comments from representatives of the parties at \nthe PHC.\n\n\n\n\nJeffery Fawcett\n04/07/2000 05:28 PM\nTo: Steven Harris/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Kevin Hyatt/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Susan \nScott/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Jeff Dasovich/SFO/EES@EES, mbaldwin@igservice.com, \nTim Aron/ET&S/Enron@ENRON, Julia White/ET&S/Enron@ENRON\ncc:  \n\nSubject: SoCal GIR settlement telecon\n\nI participated in a teleconference today at 3:00 p.m. with several members of \nthe \"all-party\" settlement group.  The ALJ assigned to the GIR case, Andrea \nBiren, has apparently issued a ruling on SoCal's Motion to Extend the \ndeadline for filing the all-party settlement.   Although I personally haven't \nseen the document yet, it was the primary focus of the meeting.\n\nAccording to accounts from the group, Judge Biren's ruling did not grant \nSoCal's motion for extension.  Rather, she will hear arguments on the motion \nduring the Prehearing Conference scheduled for Tuesday, April 11.  Judge \nBiren also asked that parties to the proceeding be prepared to file full \nscale testimony discussing all settlement proposals on file as well as offer \nany addtional comments on the most promising options set forth by the \nCommission.  Unfortunately, she is silent on what date the testimony would be \ndue (originally, testimony was due on April 17).  In addition, Judge Biren's \nruling apparently leaves open the possibility that she could be talked into \nsomething different during Tuesday's prehearing conference (ie. a different \nprocedural schedule, or an amended or streamlined testimony filing protocol).\n\nThe telecon group decided to do the following: (1) approach CPUC commissioner \nBilas on Monday and let him know the status of the all-party settlement and \nask him to intervene in favor of the extension, (2) go before Judge Biren on \nTuesday (as a group, and individually, if necessary) and request that in leiu \nof a full scale testimony procedure, would she accept a process whereby, \nsimilar to what was done in the PG&E settlement, parties file declarations in \nfavor of one settlement versus another, and then the Judge \nsupervises/conducts a panel discussion on the issues surrounding the \nsettlement?  If Judge Biren rejects the idea of a less formal process, one \nwhich arguably doesn't offer as complete a record in the case (which most on \nthe call felt was the likely outcome), then would she agree to a schedule \nwhereby she grants the SoCal motion, the all-party settlement is filed on \nApril 17, then all parties, including the Norm Pedersen group, would have the \nchance to file testimony (only testimony, not additional declarations) \nindicating support of one settlement over another and the reasons/logic, \nincluding how the settlements meet the Commisision objectives, on or before \nMay 5?\n\nAs far as the all-party settlement document is concerned, SoCal will be \nforwarding a preliminary (as yet incomplete) draft for the parties to review, \nbut not to comment on.  SoCal intends to circulate another, more complete \nversion Monday morning for purposes of soliciting comments/changes.  \n\nAs far as Transwestern is concerned, I've spoken independently with the team \n-- Susan, Mark and Jeff Dasovich.  Each of us will review and provide TW \ncomments to SoCal regarding the settlement document.  Susan will be \nrepresenting TW at the Prehearing Conference on Tuesday.  Mark Baldwin will \nbe there also to support Susan's efforts on Tuesday.  Susan and Jeff (and \nmaybe Mark?) will try and hook-up Tuesday morning to compare notes and talk \nabout the upcoming Commission PHC.\n\nSteve, between Susan and I, we'll continue to forward documentation and other \nmaterials regarding this case as well as to provide you with our comments \nand/or any drafts of testimony TW intends to file in this case.\n \n\n"

One option we were considering was a \"share the \npain\" settlement with Dreyfus, whereby they would let us buy out of the \nremaining position at a steep discount (to acknowledge their contributory \nnegligence in this matter).  Has there been any additional headway in this \narea?  I'm on vacation and haven't heard anything on this.  Weren't we going \nto send a V&E litigator to visit Dreyfus' general counsel? If we commence \nlegal proceedings against Dreyfus, things will become costly and contentious \nbetween us. Information will come slowly and grudgingly.  We have copies of \nsome of their internal notes which indicate that they knew---or should have \nknown---that something wasn't quite right with Todoroff's situation.  Before \nwe start filing discovery motions, we should exhaust the possibility of \nmeeting with their general counsel to see if a quick \"business\" settlement \ncan be obtained.  Please advise. Thanks.

Mr. Moore acknowledged receiving the investigative \nmaterials that we submitted last week, and he indicated that his office is \ncommencing its review of those materials.  I emphasized to Mr. Moore the \ndesire of EOTT's management to have this case aggressively prosecuted.  Mr. \nMoore acknowledged that the aggressive prosecution of this matter would send \na strong message to other traders who might consider dishonest acts, and he \nassured me that his office would vigorously pursue this matter.  Based upon \nsome statements made by Mr. Moore during our discussion, it was obvious that \nhe recalled much of the presentation from our initial meeting.  I will call \nMr. Moore again tomorrow afternoon to get an update on the progress of this \nmatter.\n\nWe are also attempting to obtain from Louis Dreyfus tape recordings of \nTodoroff's conversations with them regarding the series of deals that we are \ndescribing as \"The Second Transaction.\"  If Louis Dreyfus does not \nvoluntarily provide us with copies of those tapes (or if they assert that \ntapes do not exist), the next step will be to consider filing a lawsuit or \nseeking a bill of discovery in order to obtain the tapes.  Based upon some \nnotes we have received from a contract administrator at Louis Dreyfus, it \nappears that Louis Dreyfus also suspected or knew that something was amiss \nwith The Second Transaction.  Assuming that Todoroff's conversations with \nLouis Dreyfus were taped, the tapes should tell us whether Todoroff had a \nconspirator at Louis Dreyfus who assisted him in his scheme to defraud EOTT.\n\nIf Louis Dreyfus does not voluntarily produce tape recordings of its \nconversations with Todoroff, we will need some guidance from Enron as to how \naggressive we should be in attempting to obtain the tapes.\n\n"

If (when) the \ngrand jury indicts him, he's going to have a pretty tough time with a \ndefamation or libel suit. I think its a deluded puff.  SWD\n\n\nWALT \nZIMMERMAN        \n03/16/2000 01:00 PM\n\nTo: jdegeeter@velaw.com, dharvin@velaw.com\ncc: Steve Duffy/Houston/Eott@Eott, Dana Gibbs/Houston/Eott@Eott, Susan \nRalph/Houston/Eott@Eott, wlawler@velaw.com, mtuohey@velaw.com \n\nSubject: Steve Todoroff--CONFIDENTIAL/SUBJECT TO ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE\n\nI wanted you to be aware of something we learned today from one of our \ntrading counterparties.  Dana Gibbs spoke with an individual at Koch who has \nrecently spoken with Todoroff.  Apparently, Todoroff is in the job market.  \nHe has apparently indicated that he intends to sue EOTT for defamation as \nsoon as EOTT links his name with the NGL theft.  He also apparently told Koch \nthat his attorneys are \"ready to go with the lawsuit\" as soon as EOTT links \nhis name with the theft.  \n\nTodoroff's \"planned lawsuit\"  may just be some more yarn in this fabrication, \nbut it emphasizes again the need to keep this matter as confidential as \npossible (at least until Todoroff is indicted). \n\nOn a side note, Todoroff has certainly developed an interesting interview \ntechnique!  Just imagine going in for a job interview and saying, \"My former \nemployer is alleging that a former trader stole millions of $$$.   I'm just \nwaiting on them to say that I'm the thief so I can sue them.\"  With that \nstory, I'm surprised employers aren't beating down his door to give him a job.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

First, I have set up a meeting with Tom Shelton for this Friday, 3/31, at \n1:45 p.m. here at B&P, 29th floor.  I will see Knox and Neal here then.\n2.  To reiterate what Knox told me, today Ronnie (speaking generally about \nthe Beeson case, but not yet aware that Knox is involved) told Knox at a \nsocial luncheon that he does not plan to move for rehearing, but plans to go \nback to the trial court and seek a Dow Waiver class.  Thus, we are on a short \ntime frame to prepare, since Ronnie will undoubtedly do that fairly soon and \nseek a quick hearing.  In that regard, we need to, in short order:\n(i) decide whether we want to approach Dow now -- -- and then figure out the \nbest approach -- about releasing Don Ray from any constraints about \ntestifying about the first purchaser issue.  The best way to do this may be \nthrough Don Ray; he has offered to try.  Having DRG testify about the first \npurchaser issue is not essential at the certification stage, but could be \nhelpful, particularly on cross.   There IS a potential downside to exploring \nthis issue prior to certification, however, which is that it will entail \ndealing with the Glidden firm.  I will discuss the downside more in person.\n(ii) interview not only Shelton, but Hazzlerigg (in Austin), Walzel, and \nGerald Bennett.\n3.  I have already been doing quite a bit of work for a recertification \nhearing.  On Friday, I will have a full to do list for all of us to add \nto/discuss/divide up, after we've met with Shelton.\n4.  Upon recently rereading HECI v. Neel, I don't understand how this claim \ncan survive limitations.  In that case, royalty owners sued the lessee for \nfailing to notify them of overproduction from other wells in their reservoir \nthat damaged their interests.  The Supreme Court held that because RRC \nrecords would have shown the overproduction, the claim was not inherently \nundiscoverable, and thus the discovery rule could not toll limitations.  This \nseems pretty closely on point. We don't have the facts to support fraudulent \nconcealment here.  Knox has suggested we may want to move for summary \njudgment on limitations as soon as the case is returned to the trial court, \nboth to educate Link and to educate Ronnie, who was full of bravado about his \ncase at lunch.\n5.  Knox suggested at lunch that we might have a certification \"expert\" on \nRule 42, how criteria aren't met here, etc.  Neither of us wants to use Jack \nRatliff for that purpose, for multiple reasons.  Does anyone have any other \nideas?\nTalk to you soon!\n"

          "body": "Following the first instance decision in the Civil Summary Proceedings, Ross, \nTeun and myself met with Clifford Chance again yesterday to stress-test our \nlitigation strategy going forward and we arrived at the view that, at the \ncurrent juncture, the strategy we laid down over the last 10 days or so is \nstill correct.\n\nThat strategy - with an anticipated time-line is as follows:\n\n1. Friday, 26 / 5:  We file an Urgent Appeal on the Civil Summary proceedings \nin the Civil Court.  (We spent some time yesterday reviewing the draft Appeal \nproceedings).  This is the last date for filing an Appeal on the Summary \nproceedings. \n\n2. Between now and the end of next week, we try again to get Sep to confirm \nin writing the amount of t-o-p they have for energy, minimum cross-border \ncapacity required, etc. on their import contracts. \n\n3. Mid-June:  Accordingly to CC's latest intelligence, the current \nanticipated ETA of the DTe's decision in the Appeal on DTe Decision 005.\n\n4. Around mid-June:  Judge decides whether or not we are going to be granted \nwitness hearings on t-o-p obligations of Sep (these will fall away if Sep \ncomplies with point 2).\n\n5. Mid-June:  If we get a vague or adverse decision by the DTe re point 3, we \nlodge an appeal in Summary Proceedings before the CBB (the Administrative \ncourt) against the DTe's decision in the Appeal on DTe 005.  Appeal will \nprobably be lodged on grounds that Sep contracts violate EU Directive.    \n\nNote:  if the DTe's decision is adverse (e.g., t-o-p relates to capacity not \nenergy), then our Civil Appeal (point 1) will at that stage fall away.\n\n6. Mid-August:  Earliest possible date (per procedural rules) for Decision of \nCBB in Summary Proceedings Appeal (if launched) per point 5.  Could be later.\n\n7. End-August: Earliest possible date (per procedural rules) for hearing of \nCivil Summary Proceedings Appeal per point 1(note:  this will be heard if \neither DTe makes a decision favourable to us in mid-June per point 3 or if we \nget an adverse DTe appeal decision, but we get a favourable CBB appeal \ndecision per point 6 - in the latter case the Civil appeal will, in effect, \nbe \"re-instated\").\n\nIn practice, this appeal might not be heard however until end October.  \n\n8. September: Witness hearings - unless Sep complies with 2 and judge does \nnot reject our request for witness hearings per point 4.\n\n9. (End??) December:  According to latest CC intelligence, NMa will probably \nmake decision, and hence report, on our NMa complaint filed in January re \nTenneT's alocation of cross-border capacity for the Y2K.    \n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\nA.  The benefits of lodging an Appeal against the decision of the civil court \nin the Civil Summary proceedings are (a) gives us additional litigation \noptionality, (b) keeps the pressure on the system,  (c) if we are successful \non the DTe 005 appeal, or were successful in a CBB appeal against an \nunfavourable DTe 005 appeal decision, then this Civil Appeal goes to \nenforcement of that decision against Sep / TenneT and (d) was perceived to \nhave no material down-side.\n\nB.  I have requested Clifford Chance to let me have (1) estimate of costs of \nlaunching Civil Appeal + estimate of costs which we would have to pay to Sep \n/ TenneT if we lost that Appeal and (2) total of our legal costs to-date, \nbroken down between those we have paid, and those which have not yet been \nbilled or billed but unpaid + estimate of our legal costs going forward on \nthe basis of the above strategy plus estimate of costs payable by us to \ndefendants if we lose any of the above actions going forward.\n\nC.   It will be noted that the above does not take into account any Brussels' \nangle.  This needs to be reviewed again when DTe makes decision on the \nDecision 005 Appeal - i.e., probably mid-June.  \n\nD.  CC still attempting to find out when CBB will in effect decide whether or \nnot TenneT is an administrative body (which impacts the forum, and hence to a \ncertain extent, the above time-scale). \n\nE.  Clearly, legal strategy is not caste in stone but may change depending on \nhow the litigation chess-game unfolds over the next succeeding weeks and \nmonths.  This will be constantly reviewed.        \n\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n\nKind regards\n\nMark                 "

It is my hope\nthat we will leave the PHC with a planned witness order for the hearings.\nTherefore, parties should come prepared to discuss witness availability and\ncross estimates by witness. In fact, if you can provide estimates to me\ninformally prior to the PHC, I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nAny work that the parties can do ahead of time to reduce to scope of issues\nthat require cross is appreciated. In the scoping ruling, Commissioner Bilas\ndirected that a case management statement be submitted consistent with Rule\n49. We are looking forward to seeing that. In addition, I'd like you all to\nconsider offering panels of witnesses for cross in the event that you have\nsignificant alignment of positions with other parties. This should reduce\nthe time required as well. We will not tolerate repetitive cross or friendly\ncross, therefore, the parties with aligned positions should also consider\ndesignating a representative to cross witnesses in order to reduce hearing\ntime. (If witnesses have corrections to their direct or rebuttal testimony,\nthese should be submitted in writing as an errata exhibit, whenever\npossible, in order to reduce additional direct on the stand.)\n\nDuring the hearings we will run 9-1 Tuesday-Friday, Mondays we will run\n10-4. This gives us approximately 28 hours of cross time. If parties\nestimates exceed this amount of time, the Commissioner and I will allocate\ntime accordingly.\n\nIn addition, at the PHC I intend to identify the direct and rebuttal\ntestimony with exhibit numbers so that we do not need to spend time doing\nthat at the hearing. We will also set a date by which any motions to strike\ntestimony are due.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. See you in a couple of weeks!\n\nMichelle Cooke\nAdministrative Law Judge\nmlc@cpuc.ca.gov\n415 703 2637"
