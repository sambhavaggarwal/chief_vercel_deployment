They get a failed trade and it often takes 5-10 \nminutes to rectify the problem, at which time we've lost the trade.   We need \nthe major counterparties to have unlimited credit on EOL, just as they have \nin normal trading.\n\n2.  As a corrallary, I am under the impression that when a trade fails \nbecause of credit, the counterparty does not get an explanatory error message \ndescribing what happened and what to do.  When a credit failure happens, the \ncounterparty will often keep clicking on the same product, getting the same \nerror message"
